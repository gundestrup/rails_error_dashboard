# /demo-update — Update Demo App

Point the live demo app at a newly released gem version. Render auto-deploys on
push to `main`.

## Usage

- `/demo-update` — update to the latest released version
- `/demo-update 0.8.4` — update to a specific version

## Before you start

**The gem must already be live on RubyGems.** If it isn't, `bundle lock` silently
re-resolves to the previous version and you push a no-op. Check first:

```bash
curl -s https://rubygems.org/api/v1/gems/rails_error_dashboard.json | jq -r .version
```

**The Gemfile usually does not need editing.** It pins `~> 0.9`, and in
RubyGems `~> 0.9` means `>= 0.9, < 1.0` — it pins at the *first* component, so
it already allows every 0.x minor including 0.10.0. Only the lockfile changes.
You would edit it only to cross into 1.x. When unsure, check rather than guess:

```bash
ruby -e 'puts Gem::Requirement.new("~> 0.9").satisfied_by?(Gem::Version.new("0.10.0"))'
```

## The lockfile hazard

A plain `bundle lock --update=rails_error_dashboard` run with the wrong Bundler
will quietly wreck the lockfile. Observed on a real update:

- **`BUNDLED WITH` downgraded 4.0.3 -> 2.6.9**, because the local Ruby shipped an
  older Bundler than the demo expects
- **8 unrelated gems bumped** (`rack`, `zeitwerk`, `json`, `reline`, `erb`,
  `io-console`, `rbs`)
- **local platform added** (`arm64-darwin-23`), which does not belong in a
  lockfile deployed to Linux

Any of these can break the Render deploy for reasons unrelated to the gem bump.
The demo pins **Ruby 3.4.5** and **Bundler 4.0.3** — match both.

## Steps

1. **Verify the target version is published** (see above).

2. **Use the demo's Bundler**, not whatever is on PATH:
   ```bash
   gem install bundler -v 4.0.3 --no-document   # once per machine
   ```

3. **Update the lockfile conservatively** — `--conservative` stops Bundler
   bumping unrelated gems:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/anjan/code/RED/rails_error_dashboard_demo_app
   bundler _4.0.3_ lock --conservative --update=rails_error_dashboard
   ```
   Use `bundle lock`, never `bundle install` — installing compiles native gems
   (sqlite3 does not build cleanly on recent macOS) and is unnecessary here.

4. **Remove the local platform line** if Bundler added one. It re-adds the
   running machine's platform on every resolve, so strip it after the final
   `lock` and do not re-resolve afterwards:
   ```bash
   sed -i '' '/^  arm64-darwin-2[0-9]$/d' Gemfile.lock   # keep 24/25 if already tracked
   ```
   Check `PLATFORMS` afterwards — it must still list `x86_64-linux` for Render.

5. **Review the diff before committing.** A clean patch bump is exactly two
   lines, the version and its checksum:
   ```bash
   git diff Gemfile.lock | grep -E "^[+-]" | grep -v "^[+-][+-]"
   ```
   If you see `BUNDLED WITH`, unrelated gem versions, or new platforms, reset with
   `git checkout Gemfile.lock` and redo from step 2.

6. **IF THE RELEASE SHIPS A MIGRATION, COMMIT IT AND BOTH SCHEMA DUMPS.**

   This is not cosmetic — miss it and the affected dashboard page 500s in
   production. `bin/docker-entrypoint` runs `db:prepare` on boot, which applies
   *pending* migrations, but only ones that exist in the repo. A lockfile bump
   alone gives the demo gem code that reads a column its database lacks.

   Check first:
   ```bash
   ls /Users/anjan/code/RED/rails_error_dashboard/db/migrate/ | tail -3
   grep -n 'define(version' db/schema.rb
   ```
   If the gem has a migration newer than the demo's schema version, copy it by
   hand — `bin/rails error_dashboard:install:migrations` **cannot run here**,
   because the demo's gems are not installed and step 3 forbids
   `bundle install`:
   ```bash
   cp ../rails_error_dashboard/db/migrate/<TS>_<name>.rb \
      db/migrate/<TS>_<name>.rails_error_dashboard.rb
   ```
   Add the provenance line its siblings carry, directly above the class:
   `# This migration comes from rails_error_dashboard (originally <TS>)`

   Then hand-edit **both** `db/schema.rb` and `db/error_dashboard_schema.rb`:
   bump `define(version:)` to the new timestamp and add the column.
   **Column order is by type, not alphabetical** — Rails groups `t.string`
   together, so a new string column can land *before* `updated_at`. Diff
   against the gem's `spec/dummy/db/schema.rb`, which is authoritative:
   ```bash
   diff <(sed -n '/create_table "<table>"/,/^  end/p' db/error_dashboard_schema.rb) \
        <(sed -n '/create_table "<table>"/,/^  end/p' ../rails_error_dashboard/spec/dummy/db/schema.rb)
   ```

   Note: `config/database.yml` names `migrations_paths: db/error_dashboard_migrate`
   for the error_dashboard database, but that directory does not exist — every
   RED migration lives in `db/migrate/`. Follow the precedent (commit 8859bc4,
   which added `rack_attack_events` in 0.8.3), not the config.

7. **Check whether the seed file needs updating** — `db/seeds.rb` only needs work
   if the new version added a feature that requires demo data to show anything.

   **The test is not "did the feature ship", it is "can a visitor SEE it".** If
   step 8 is about to add a landing-page card for the feature, that card links
   to a page which must not be empty. 0.10.0 shipped AI crawler tracking and
   `/red/errors/rack_attack_summary` read "no events can be recorded", because
   nothing had ever written to that table on the demo.

   Seeding notes learned there:
   - Check the table's **unique index** before writing rows. `rack_attack_events`
     is keyed on `(rule, match_type, discriminator, path, period_hour,
     application_id)`, so every seeded row must differ in at least one.
   - Some tables are **hourly aggregates, not request logs**. Seed buckets
     across a range of hours so the page's time filters have something to do.
   - Where a classifier decides what renders (`AiAgentClassifier` here), verify
     your fixture strings against it rather than assuming — and include a
     negative case (Googlebot is named but `ai=false`) so the page demonstrates
     the distinction rather than counting everything as a hit.
   - Vary the shape. Flat identical counts across every bucket read as
     synthetic; assistants spiking in working hours while crawlers grind
     steadily reads as traffic.
   - **Add the model to the `CLEAR_BEFORE_SEED` block.** `bin/docker-entrypoint`
     reseeds on every boot, so anything missing there accumulates per deploy.
   - Guard new model references with `defined?`, so the seed still runs against
     an older gem.

8. **UPDATE THE LANDING-PAGE COPY. This is the step that gets missed.**

   `app/views/pages/home.html.erb` has three places that describe *what* the
   release contains. None of them update themselves, and the version number
   sitting next to them DOES — so a stale headline reads as a fresh claim about
   the new version. The hero pill shipped reading
   `v0.9.0 · Storm protection` for two releases after storm protection landed
   in 0.8.2.

   | What | Where | Auto? |
   |---|---|---|
   | Hero pill version tag | `<span class="pill-tag">v<%= @version %></span>` | **yes** — `@version` is `RailsErrorDashboard::VERSION` |
   | **Hero pill headline** | the `<span>` right after it | **NO — hardcoded** |
   | **Feature card** | a `.gcell` in the `grid-features` section | **NO** |
   | **Card version badge** | `<span class="vbadge">vX.Y.Z</span>` | **NO** |
   | Footer / install snippet version | `<%= @version %>` | **yes** |

   For a release with a user-visible headline feature:
   - Rewrite the hero pill headline to name it (short — it sits on one line).
   - Add a `.gcell` to the `grid-features` grid, newest first, with a
     `<span class="vbadge">` naming the version that introduced it.
   - Badge the version the feature SHIPPED IN, not the current version. Storm
     protection stays `v0.8.2` forever.

   For a patch release with no user-visible feature (a security or bug fix),
   leave the copy alone — the version numbers update themselves.

   Verify by loading `/` and reading the pill: the version tag and the headline
   beside it must describe the same release.

9. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add Gemfile.lock            # add Gemfile too only if you edited it
   git add app/views/pages/home.html.erb   # if you changed the copy in step 8
   git commit -m "chore: update rails_error_dashboard to X.Y.Z"
   git push origin main
   ```

10. **Confirm the deploy** — Render redeploys automatically; the site updates
   within a few minutes. Load the dashboard and confirm the footer version, and
   load `/` to confirm the hero pill reads correctly.
