  # HOW RUBYGEMS.ORG RENDERS THIS — do not reformat without re-reading.
  #
  # rubygems.org's RubygemsHelper#simple_markup gates on the regexp
  #
  #     /^==+ [A-Z]/
  #
  # If it matches, the text is rendered through RDoc::Markup: headings,
  # paragraphs, bullet lists and auto-linked URLs. If it does NOT match, the
  # entire description is dumped into one <p> — the cramped wall of text with an
  # unclickable demo link that this gem shipped for months.
  #
  # The anchor is ^, so a heading must begin at COLUMN 0. An earlier attempt used
  # <<~DESC with the body indented two spaces past its terminator; <<~ strips
  # only the *common* indentation, so every line retained two leading spaces, the
  # regexp never matched, and that "fix" would have rendered exactly as broken as
  # the text it replaced. Hence <<-DESC with the content flush left.
  #
  # spec/gemspec_description_spec.rb asserts the gate matches and that the
  # rendered HTML really contains headings, a list and an anchor tag.

== Rails-native failure investigation

Rails Error Dashboard (RED) is an open-source, self-hosted Rails engine for
investigating production exceptions without sending error data to a monitoring
vendor. It groups errors and records request context and cause chains and, when
enabled, breadcrumbs plus local and instance variables captured before Ruby
unwinds the stack.

== What it records

* Rails and Ruby runtime health on the error record, refreshed on every captured
  occurrence: Active Record pool, Puma, background jobs, GC, memory, threads,
  file descriptors and system pressure
* Built-in storm protection that progressively sheds expensive context and I/O
  during error floods while retaining useful exemplars and exact occurrence
  counts
* Copy as RSpec, curl or LLM prompt; swallowed-exception detection; LLM
  observability without prompt capture; OpenTelemetry span export
* Workflow, notifications (Slack, Email, Discord, PagerDuty, webhooks) and
  two-way issue sync with GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg and Linear
* Rails-specific operational views: jobs, database, cache, Action Cable, Active
  Storage, Rack::Attack and deprecations

== Running it

Run RED with your application's database or an isolated error database, on
PostgreSQL, MySQL/Trilogy or SQLite. The dashboard is translated into 11
languages (French native-reviewed; the rest machine-translated and awaiting
native review). A
self-hosted Sentry alternative that keeps error data in your own database. The
gem is MIT and free forever.

Supports Rails 7.0-8.1 and Ruby 3.2-4.0. Beta: APIs may change before 1.0.

    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    First install:
       rails generate rails_error_dashboard:install
       rails db:migrate
       # Route and config are set up automatically by the generator.

    Upgrading from a previous version:
       rails generate rails_error_dashboard:install
       rails db:migrate
       # The generator detects your existing config and only adds new migrations.

    Separate database users:
       rails generate rails_error_dashboard:install
       rails db:migrate:error_dashboard
       # See docs for full separate-DB setup.

  # Rails dependencies
  spec.add_dependency "rails", ">= 7.0.0"

  # Pagination
  spec.add_dependency "pagy", "~> 43.0"

  # Grouping and time-based queries
  spec.add_dependency "groupdate", "~> 6.0"

  # Optional dependencies — features degrade gracefully without these:
  # browser (~> 6.0)    — richer platform detection (falls back to regex)
  # chartkick (~> 5.0)  — chart helpers (falls back to CDN-only JS)
  # httparty (>= 0.24)  — Discord/PagerDuty/webhook notifications (falls back to Net::HTTP)
  # turbo-rails (~> 2.0) — real-time Turbo Stream updates (without it the dashboard does not auto-refresh)

  # concurrent-ruby powers the storm-protection primitives (AtomicReference,
  # AtomicFixnum, Map) — a real runtime dependency, not incidental.
  #
  # This was previously pinned to "< 1.3.7" for Rails 7.0 compatibility:
  # concurrent-ruby 1.3.5 dropped its `logger` dependency, which broke
  # ActiveSupport on Rails < 7.0.10 (rails/rails#54271, fixed in
  # rails/rails#54264).
  #
  # That ceiling was removed because it did not do what it claimed. Verified
  # empirically on Ruby 3.2 and 3.4: Rails 7.0.8.7 raises
  # `uninitialized constant ActiveSupport::LoggerThreadSafeLevel::Logger`
  # with concurrent-ruby 1.3.4 and 1.3.6 as well — both of which the old pin
  # ALLOWED. The real boundary is Rails 7.0.10+, independent of the
  # concurrent-ruby version, so the ceiling protected nobody while forcing
  # every user onto 1.3.6, which carries three CVEs fixed in 1.3.7:
  # CVE-2026-54904 (AtomicReference#update livelock on Float::NAN),
  # CVE-2026-54905 (ReentrantReadWriteLock read-count overflow),
  # CVE-2026-54906 (ReadWriteLock thread-safety).
  #
  # For the record, none of the three is reachable through OUR code: the single
  # AtomicReference (count_buffer.rb) only ever holds a Concurrent::Map, never
  # a Float, and we use no ReadWriteLock at all. The reason not to hold users
  # on 1.3.6 is their OTHER gems, plus the bundle-audit noise it generates in
  # every downstream app.
  #
  # "~> 1.3" matches how Rails itself depends on concurrent-ruby (~> 1.0,
  # >= 1.3.1) rather than being stricter than the framework. An upper bound in
  # a Rails ENGINE is especially costly — it becomes an unsatisfiable-conflict
  # generator against every other gem in the host app. New installs resolve to
  # 1.3.8; existing lockfiles are free to stay where they are.
