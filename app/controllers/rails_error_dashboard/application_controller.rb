    # default_protect_from_forgery registers verify_authenticity_token on
    # ActionController::Base, ahead of anything declared here; an unauthenticated
    # POST was then answered about its token (and by the error renderer) instead
    # of with a 401.

    # Three details are load-bearing:
    #
    # 1. The previous value is read from Thread.current directly, NOT from
    #    Pagy::I18n.locale. The getter coerces nil to "en", so restoring through
    #    it would stamp "en" onto a thread that started clean — making the
    #    dashboard a source of the very leak it is fixing.
    # 2. around_action + ensure, not before_action. A before_action would strand
    #    the dashboard's locale on the thread for the host app's next request.
    #    The ensure also covers the rescue_from handlers above, which still
    #    render through the view layer.
    # 3. RED's own locale is set on RailsErrorDashboard::Current, NOT via
    #    I18n.with_locale. RED translates through a private backend
    #    (I18nStore); touching the host's I18n.locale would mutate host global
    #    state for no benefit and re-introduce exactly the coupling #148 removed.
    #
    # Pagy's locale and RED's are resolved independently: they ship different

    # the UI translated, with English pagination, rather than raising.
