module RailsErrorDashboard
  # View-layer entry point for RED's translations.
  #
  # The helper is deliberately named red_t, not t. Two reasons:
  #
  #   1. Overriding `t` in an engine helper risks colliding with the host app's
  #      own helpers and with Rails' built-in translate, which has lazy-lookup
  #      behaviour ("t('.title')") that RED's private backend does not provide.
  #   2. An explicit name makes every translated site greppable — worth a lot
  #      when the remaining ~1,600 strings get extracted a page at a time.
  module I18nHelper
    # red_js_t needs escape_javascript. In a request the controller mixes every
    # engine helper into one view context, so it happens to be there — but that
    # is incidental, and it is absent in a type: :helper spec or anywhere this
    # module is included on its own. Include it explicitly rather than depend on
    # the ambient context; the same fix P2-T11 applied to the T10 helpers.

    #
    # Output is HTML-escaped unless the key ends in _html, matching Rails'
    # convention. Escaping happens here rather than in I18nStore because it is
    # a view concern — mailers' text parts and JS payloads must not be escaped.
