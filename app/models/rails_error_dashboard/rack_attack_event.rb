  # Stores aggregated Rack::Attack throttle/blocklist/track events per hourly bucket.

  # Rack::Attack events are NOT errors — a throttled request returns HTTP 429 without
  # raising. They are therefore persisted independently of error_logs rather than as
  # a side-effect of error capture (see issue #143).

  # Rows are aggregated hourly by (rule, match_type, discriminator, path) so that a
  # rate-limit flood collapses to a handful of rows instead of one INSERT per request.

    # excluded from the per-rule listing and surfaced separately.
