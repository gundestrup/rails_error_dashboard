---

### Jorge Rodriguez ([@j4rs](https://github.com/j4rs))

- ✨ [#92](https://github.com/AnjanJ/rails_error_dashboard/pull/92) - Added mute/unmute feature for notification suppression — muted errors still appear in the dashboard but skip all notifications (Slack, email, Discord, PagerDuty, webhooks). Includes batch mute/unmute, "Hide muted" filter, bell-slash icon in error list, and a clean `maybe_notify` refactor in LogError

### Gaël Marziou ([@gmarziou](https://github.com/gmarziou))

- ✨ [#123](https://github.com/AnjanJ/rails_error_dashboard/pull/123) - Added the AI Help drawer on the error detail page. When an LLM provider is configured, users can ask follow-up questions about the current error and receive streamed Markdown answers from OpenAI (GPT-5 via Responses API, GPT-4 via Chat Completions) or Anthropic (Claude Sonnet via Messages API) without leaving the dashboard. Includes SSE streaming, lambda-friendly API keys, sensitive-data filtering integration, and a privacy note in the README

---

### Barnabé ([@BarnabeD](https://github.com/BarnabeD))

- 🐛 [#211](https://github.com/AnjanJ/rails_error_dashboard/pull/211) - Replaced the `:exponentially_longer` retry backoff, removed in Rails 7.2, with `:polynomially_longer` in the base job and the troubleshooting docs (v0.11.9)

---

### Yoshihiro Okamoto ([@10rayan](https://github.com/10rayan))

- 🌐 [#258](https://github.com/AnjanJ/rails_error_dashboard/pull/258) - Native-speaker review of the Japanese translation: clearer, more natural labels for "Your Code", the raw user agent, and storm protection's reduced capture (v0.14.2)
