# Settings Dashboard

The Settings page provides a read-only view of your Rails Error Dashboard configuration, making it easy to verify which features are enabled and review current settings without digging through initializer files.

---

## Accessing Settings

Navigate to the Settings page from the main dashboard:

1. Click the **gear icon** (⚙️) in the navigation bar
2. Or visit `/error_dashboard/settings` directly

**Authentication**: Requires HTTP Basic Auth (same credentials as dashboard access)

---

## Settings Overview

The Settings page is organized into seven sections:

### 1. Core Features

Shows the status of fundamental dashboard features:

- **Error Middleware**: Whether the error-catching middleware is active
- **Rails.error Subscriber**: Whether Rails 7+ error reporter integration is active
- **Authentication**: Confirms HTTP Basic Auth is always enforced
- **Data Retention**: Number of days errors are kept before auto-deletion
- **Max Backtrace Lines**: Stack trace depth limit
- **Sampling Rate**: Percentage of errors being logged (100% = all errors)

**Example Display:**
```text
Error Middleware                 ✓ Enabled
Rails.error Subscriber          ✓ Enabled
Authentication                   🔒 Always Required
Data Retention                   90 days
Max Backtrace Lines              50 lines
Sampling Rate                    100%
```

---

### 2. Performance Settings

Displays async logging and database optimization settings:

- **Async Logging**: Whether errors are logged in background jobs
  - Shows the adapter being used in parentheses (e.g., "Sidekiq", ":async")
- **Separate Database**: Whether errors use a dedicated database

**Example Display:**
```text
Async Logging                    ✓ Enabled (Sidekiq)
Separate Database                ✗ Disabled
```

**When separate database is enabled:**
```text
Separate Database                ✓ Enabled
```

---

### 3. Notification Channels

Shows which notification channels are configured and active:

- **Slack Notifications**: Webhook URL (masked) and status
- **Email Notifications**: Recipients count and status
- **Discord Notifications**: Webhook URL (masked) and status
- **PagerDuty Notifications**: Integration key (masked) and status
- **Custom Webhooks**: Number of configured webhooks

**Example Display:**
```text
Slack Notifications              ✓ Enabled (https://hooks.slack...T123)
Email Notifications              ✓ Enabled (3 recipients)
Discord Notifications            ✗ Disabled
PagerDuty Notifications          ✓ Enabled (Critical errors only)
Custom Webhooks                  2 configured
```

**Security Note**: Webhook URLs and sensitive keys are partially masked for security (e.g., `https://hooks.slack.com/services/...T123`).

---

### 4. Advanced Analytics Features

Displays the status of all 7 advanced analytics features:

- **Similar Errors (Fuzzy Matching)**: Fuzzy error matching with Jaccard/Levenshtein algorithms
- **Co-occurring Errors**: Errors happening together detection
- **Error Cascades**: Parent→child error relationship tracking
- **Error Correlation**: Version/user/time correlation analysis
- **Platform Comparison**: iOS vs Android analytics and health comparison
- **Occurrence Patterns**: Cyclical and burst pattern detection
- **Baseline Alerts**: Statistical anomaly detection (shows threshold in standard deviations)

**Example Display:**
```text
Similar Errors                   ✓ Enabled
Co-occurring Errors              ✓ Enabled
Error Cascades                   ✗ Disabled
Error Correlation                ✓ Enabled
Platform Comparison              ✓ Enabled
Occurrence Patterns              ✗ Disabled
Baseline Alerts                  ✓ Enabled (2.0 std devs)
```

**Baseline Alert Details:**
When baseline alerts are enabled, additional information is shown:
- Threshold (standard deviations)
- Cooldown period (minutes between alerts)
- Severities being monitored

---

### 5. Active Plugins

Shows registered custom plugins and their status:

- **Plugin Name**: The name of the plugin
- **Version**: Plugin version number
- **Description**: Brief description of what the plugin does
- **Status**: Whether the plugin is active or inactive

**Example Display:**

| Plugin Name    | Version | Description              | Status   |
|----------------|---------|--------------------------|----------|
| Jira Plugin    | 1.0.0   | Create Jira tickets      | ✓ Active |
| Metrics Plugin | 1.0.0   | Export to DataDog        | ✓ Active |
| Audit Log      | 1.0.0   | Track all changes        | ⏸ Inactive |

**When no plugins are registered:**
```text
No plugins are currently registered. You can create custom plugins to extend functionality.
```

See [Plugin System Guide](../PLUGIN_SYSTEM.md) for how to create custom plugins.

---

### 6. Enhanced Metrics

Displays additional context being tracked with errors (shown only if any of these are configured):

- **App Version**: Application version string
- **Git SHA**: Git commit SHA being tracked (with clickable link if git_repo_url configured)
- **Total Users**: User count for impact percentage calculations

**Example Display:**
```text
App Version                      1.2.3
Git SHA                          abc123d (linked to commit)
Total Users                      10,000
```

**Note**: This section only appears when at least one of these values is configured in your initializer.

---

### 7. Internal Logging

Shows gem debugging and logging settings:

- **Internal Logging**: Whether the gem outputs debug logs
- **Log Level**: Verbosity level (INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR)

**Example Display:**
```text
Internal Logging                 ✗ Disabled
Log Level                        INFO
```

**When enabled (not recommended for production):**
```text
Internal Logging                 ⚠ Enabled
Log Level                        DEBUG
```

---

## Use Cases

### 1. Verify Feature Activation

**Scenario**: You enabled baseline alerts in the initializer but want to confirm it's active.

**Solution**: Check the "Advanced Analytics Features" section (Section 4) for "Baseline Alerts" status.

---

### 2. Audit Production Configuration

**Scenario**: Before deploying to production, verify which features are enabled.

**Solution**: Review all sections to ensure:
- Async logging is enabled
- Appropriate notification channels are active
- Sampling rate is configured correctly
- Database settings match infrastructure

---

### 3. Troubleshoot Notification Issues

**Scenario**: Slack notifications aren't arriving.

**Solution**: Check the "Notification Channels" section (Section 3) to verify:
1. Slack Notifications shows "Enabled"
2. Webhook URL is present and partially visible (matches your configured webhook)
3. Email also shows recipients if configured

---

### 4. Review Data Retention Policy

**Scenario**: Database growing too large, want to check retention settings.

**Solution**: Check "Core Features" section for "Data Retention" setting. If it's 90 days and you want less, update initializer to 30 days.

---

### 5. Verify Advanced Analytics Features

**Scenario**: Correlation analysis isn't showing data.

**Solution**: Check the "Advanced Analytics Features" section (Section 4) - if "Error Correlation" shows "Disabled", enable it in the initializer.

---

## Important Notes

### Read-Only View

The Settings page is **read-only**. To change settings:

1. Edit `config/initializers/rails_error_dashboard.rb`
2. Restart your Rails server
3. Refresh the Settings page to see updated values

**Example:**
```ruby
# config/initializers/rails_error_dashboard.rb
RailsErrorDashboard.configure do |config|
  config.enable_baseline_alerts = true  # Change this
end
```

After restarting, Settings page will show:
```text
Baseline Alerts                  ✓ Enabled (2.0 std devs)
```

---

### Security Considerations

**Masked Sensitive Data:**
- Webhook URLs show only protocol and last 4 characters
- API keys show only last 4 characters
- Passwords are never displayed

**Access Control:**
- Settings page requires HTTP Basic Auth
- No API endpoint for programmatic access (security by design)
- Only accessible to authenticated dashboard users

---

### Configuration Validation

The Settings page shows **current active configuration**, not what's in the file. This is useful for:

1. **Environment Variable Overrides**: If ENV vars override initializer, Settings shows actual active value
2. **Default Values**: Shows what defaults are being used when not explicitly configured
3. **Feature Detection**: Confirms which optional features are actually loaded

**Example:**
If your initializer has:
```ruby
config.slack_webhook_url = ENV["SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"]
```

Settings page will show:
- "Not configured" if `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is not set
- Masked webhook URL if the environment variable is present

---

## Troubleshooting

### Settings Page Shows Different Values Than Initializer

**Cause**: Environment variables might be overriding initializer values.

**Solution**: Check for ENV var usage in initializer:
```ruby
# This will use ENV var if present, initializer value as fallback
config.option = ENV.fetch("OPTION", "default_value")
```

Run `echo $OPTION` in your shell to see actual environment value.

---

### Feature Shows "Enabled" But Not Working

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Background Jobs Not Running**:
   - Async logging enabled but Sidekiq/Solid Queue not running
   - Check: `ps aux | grep sidekiq`

2. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Notification channel enabled but webhook URL not configured
   - Check: Settings page shows "Not configured" for webhook

3. **Insufficient Data**:
   - Advanced analytics enabled but minimum data not available yet
   - Check: Analytics pages for "Insufficient data" messages

---

### Cannot Access Settings Page

**Problem**: 401 Unauthorized or authentication prompt loops.

**Solution**:
1. Verify credentials in initializer match what you're entering
2. Check for browser cached credentials (clear browser cache)
3. Try incognito/private browsing window
4. Verify `dashboard_username` and `dashboard_password` are set

---

## Navigating from Settings

From the Settings page, you can:

- **Back to Dashboard**: Click "Back to Dashboard" button
- **Main navigation**: Use navbar to access other sections
- **Direct links**: Settings page has no direct links to other pages (read-only view)

---

## API Access

**Note**: There is no API endpoint for accessing settings programmatically. This is intentional for security reasons.

**Alternative**: If you need programmatic access to configuration:
```ruby
# In Rails console or application code
config = RailsErrorDashboard.configuration
config.async_logging  # => true
config.retention_days  # => 90
```
