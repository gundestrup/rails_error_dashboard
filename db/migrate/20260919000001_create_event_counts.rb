# Time buckets for storm-shed event volume.
#
# Every time-window figure on the dashboard ("errors today", the daily trend,
# the hourly chart, the error rate) used to filter error_logs by occurred_at
# and then SUM(occurrence_count). occurred_at is FIRST-SEEN and is never
# rewritten on recurrence, so that sum reports the lifetime volume of the
# groups born inside the window -- not the events that happened in it. An
# error first seen at 23:59 and recurring at 00:01 reported "0 errors today"
# and put both events on yesterday.
#
# The obvious fix -- count error_occurrences rows in the window -- is wrong on
# its own. Storm protection deliberately writes NO occurrence row while
# shedding: it folds N events into occurrence_count and nothing else. Counting
# occurrence rows would therefore erase storm volume from every time window,
# which is exactly when the numbers matter most.
#
# So shed volume needs its own timestamp, and this is it: one row per
# (error group, 15-minute bucket), holding how many shed events landed in it.
# Window volume is then
#
#   occurrence rows in the window + shed bucket counts in the window
#
# which is correct for both ordinary and shed events.
#
# Small by construction: a row is written only while a storm is actually
# shedding, at most one per group per quarter hour.
#
# Cleanup follows the GROUP, not the bucket's own age: RetentionCleanupJob
# deletes the buckets of groups it expires, and ErrorLog has_many :event_counts
# with dependent: :delete_all covers an explicit destroy. Buckets of a
# still-active group are deliberately kept -- pruning them by bucket_at alone
# would silently redistribute those events onto the group's first-seen date,
# because EventVolume falls back to the group's lifetime count for any group
# with no per-event record left.
#
# (An earlier version of this comment claimed pruning "on bucket_at" that was
# never implemented. Both mechanisms above are now covered by
# spec/models/rails_error_dashboard/event_count_cleanup_spec.rb.)
