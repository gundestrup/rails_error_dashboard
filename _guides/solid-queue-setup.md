# Solid Queue Setup Guide

This guide covers running RailsErrorDashboard's jobs on **Solid Queue**, the default Active Job backend in Rails 8.

## What is Solid Queue?

Solid Queue is a **database-backed Active Job adapter**, the default since Rails 8.0. It provides:
- ✅ No external dependencies (Redis, etc.)
- ✅ ACID guarantees for job processing
- ✅ Built-in job monitoring and inspection
- ✅ Simple deployment (no additional services)
- ✅ Works with any Rails-supported database

## What RED needs from Solid Queue

RED's jobs run on your app's own Active Job adapter. RED writes nothing for Solid Queue: no config, no schedule, no schema. With Solid Queue, three things must be true in every environment that runs jobs:

1. **A dispatcher.** Every environment section of `config/queue.yml` needs a `dispatchers:` block. A section with `workers:` and no `dispatchers:` starts no dispatcher, so no delayed job ever runs: RED's retries, and your app's own `retry_on wait:` and `perform_later(wait:)`.
2. **A worker for RED's queues.** RED uses `default` and `error_notifications` (with your `queue_name_prefix`, if you set one). A `"*"` worker processes them, and your app's other queues too.
3. **A running worker process**: `bin/jobs`, or Solid Queue's Puma plugin (`SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA=1`). Without one, errors logged asynchronously wait in the queue and are never recorded.

Check your config with:

```bash
bin/rails error_dashboard:verify
```

It reports "Solid Queue config... OK", or the problem in each environment. It checks the file, so it can't tell whether a worker process is running.

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up Solid Queue

Rails 8 apps come with Solid Queue set up. For an older app, follow [Solid Queue's installation guide](https://github.com/rails/solid_queue#installation). RED adds nothing to it, and its generated `config/queue.yml` (a `"*"` worker and a dispatcher) already covers everything above.

> **Already using Solid Queue? Edit `config/queue.yml`; don't re-run Solid Queue's installer to fix it.** As of Solid Queue 1.7.0, `bin/rails solid_queue:install` also rewrites the queue settings in `config/environments/production.rb` to use a separate `queue` database. That breaks an app that runs Solid Queue on its main database. The installer also offers to overwrite `config/recurring.yml`, where your scheduled jobs live.

> **Ran `rails generate rails_error_dashboard:solid_queue` before 0.14.3?** It wrote a `config/queue.yml` with workers and no `dispatchers:`. With that file Solid Queue runs no dispatcher, so no delayed job ever runs, your app's own included. Its workers also served only RED's two queues. Replace the file's contents with the [example below](#environment-specific-settings), keeping any other environment sections you have (`staging:`, for example) as `<<: *default`. Since 0.14.3 the generator writes nothing; it only checks your config.

### 2. Check Your Config

```bash
bin/rails error_dashboard:verify
```

Run it again after any change to `config/queue.yml`: it checks every environment in the file.

Solid Queue 1.6+ can also check its own config: `RAILS_ENV=production bin/jobs check`. That catches other mistakes, such as a typo in `config/recurring.yml`. It passes a section with workers and no dispatcher, though, so run both.

### 3. Configure ActiveJob Adapter

In `config/application.rb` or environment-specific config:

```ruby
# For all environments
config.active_job.queue_adapter = :solid_queue

# Or environment-specific in config/environments/production.rb
config.active_job.queue_adapter = :solid_queue
```

### 4. Enable Async Logging

In `config/initializers/rails_error_dashboard.rb`:

```ruby
RailsErrorDashboard.configure do |config|
  config.async_logging = true
  config.async_adapter = :solid_queue
end
```

### 5. Start Workers

In development:
```bash
bin/jobs
```

In production (using a process manager like systemd or Supervisor):
```bash
bundle exec rake solid_queue:start
```

## Configuration Details

### Queue Structure

RailsErrorDashboard uses two queues:

1. **`default`** - Async error logging (high volume, fast database operations)
2. **`error_notifications`** - External notifications (lower volume, slower API calls)

### Environment-Specific Settings

Keep Solid Queue's own structure. **Every environment section needs a `dispatchers:` block**: a section that lists `workers:` and no `dispatchers:` runs no dispatcher, so no delayed job or retry ever runs, your app's included. Keep a `"*"` worker so your app's other queues are processed too.

If RED's notifications need their own threads, add a worker for `error_notifications` next to the `"*"` one:

```yaml
default: &default
  dispatchers:
    - polling_interval: 1
      batch_size: 500
  workers:
    - queues: "*"                     # every queue: your app's and RED's
      threads: 3
      processes: <%= ENV.fetch("JOB_CONCURRENCY", 1) %>
      polling_interval: 0.1
    - queues: error_notifications     # optional: dedicated threads for Slack, email and issue jobs
      threads: 2
      polling_interval: 0.5

development:
  <<: *default

test:
  <<: *default

production:
  <<: *default
```

Run `bin/rails error_dashboard:verify` after editing: it checks every environment in the file.

## Performance Tuning

### Thread Count

**For `default` queue (database operations):**
- Start with 5 threads
- Increase if you see job backlogs during error spikes
- Database connection pool must be >= thread count

**For `error_notifications` queue (external APIs):**
- Start with 3 threads
- Too many threads can hit API rate limits (Slack, PagerDuty, etc.)
- External APIs are slow - more threads = more concurrent API calls

### Process Count

**Multiple processes provide:**
- Better CPU utilization (true parallelism)
- Fault isolation (one process crash doesn't stop all jobs)
- Higher throughput for CPU-bound jobs

**Guidelines:**
- `default` queue: 1-2 processes in production
- `error_notifications` queue: Usually 1 process is sufficient
- Monitor memory usage (each process loads full Rails app)

### Polling Interval

**Shorter intervals (0.1 - 0.5s):**
- ✅ Near real-time job execution
- ❌ More database queries (polling overhead)

**Longer intervals (1 - 5s):**
- ✅ Lower database load
- ❌ Slower job pickup (higher latency)

**Recommendations:**
- Production: 0.5s (good balance)
- Development: 1s (lower overhead)
- Test: 0.1s (fast test execution)

## Database Connection Pool

Solid Queue uses database connections for job processing. Ensure your connection pool is large enough:

```ruby
# config/database.yml
production:
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 10 } %>
```

**Formula:**
```text
Required connections = (threads_per_worker × processes) + web_server_threads + 5
```

**Example:**
- Default queue: 5 threads × 2 processes = 10
- Error notifications: 3 threads × 1 process = 3
- Web server: 5 threads
- Buffer: 5
- **Total: 23 connections minimum**

## Monitoring

### Check Job Status

```bash
# Rails console
SolidQueue::Job.pending.count
SolidQueue::Job.failed.count
SolidQueue::Job.where(queue_name: 'default').count
```

### View Failed Jobs

```ruby
SolidQueue::Job.failed.each do |job|
  puts "#{job.class_name}: #{job.exception_message}"
end
```

### Retry Failed Jobs

Solid Queue automatically retries failed jobs with exponential backoff.

Configuration in `config/solid_queue.yml`:
```yaml
production:
  max_retries: 5
  retry_delay: 10  # seconds
```

## Deployment

### Systemd Service (Linux)

Create `/etc/systemd/system/rails-jobs.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Rails Solid Queue Workers
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=deploy
WorkingDirectory=/var/www/myapp
Environment=RAILS_ENV=production
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/bundle exec rake solid_queue:start
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable rails-jobs
sudo systemctl start rails-jobs
sudo systemctl status rails-jobs
```

### Docker

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM ruby:3.4

# ... app setup ...

# Start both web and workers
CMD ["foreman", "start"]
```

```procfile
# Procfile
web: bundle exec rails server
worker: bundle exec rake solid_queue:start
```

### Heroku

Add to `Procfile`:
```procfile
web: bundle exec rails server
worker: bundle exec rake solid_queue:start
```

Scale workers:
```bash
heroku ps:scale worker=1
```

## Troubleshooting

### Jobs not processing

1. **Check workers are running:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep solid_queue
   ```

2. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f log/solid_queue.log
   ```

3. **Verify configuration:**
   ```ruby
   # Rails console
   Rails.application.config.active_job.queue_adapter
   # => :solid_queue
   ```

### High database load

1. **Increase polling interval** (reduce query frequency)
2. **Add database indexes** on `solid_queue_jobs` table
3. **Use connection pooling** properly

### Memory usage high

1. **Reduce process count** (each process loads full Rails app)
2. **Reduce thread count** (threads share memory but still consume)
3. **Monitor with** `ps aux` or `htop`

### Job backlog building up

1. **Increase thread count** for affected queue
2. **Add more processes** (horizontal scaling)
3. **Check for slow external APIs** (notifications)

## Solid Queue vs Sidekiq

| Feature | Solid Queue | Sidekiq |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Dependencies** | Database only | Redis required |
| **Setup complexity** | Simple | Moderate |
| **Performance** | Good (DB-backed) | Excellent (memory-backed) |
| **Reliability** | Excellent (ACID) | Very good |
| **Monitoring** | Rails queries | Web UI (paid) |
| **Cost** | Free | Free + optional Pro |
| **Best for** | Small-medium apps, simple deployments | High-volume, performance-critical |

**Recommendation:**
- **Use Solid Queue** for most Rails 8.1+ apps (simpler, fewer dependencies)
- **Use Sidekiq** if you need maximum performance or already use Redis
