and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **ActionCable connection monitoring** — Track WebSocket channel actions, transmissions, subscription confirmations, and rejections as breadcrumbs. No error tracker (Sentry, Honeybadger, Faultline) surfaces ActionCable health alongside HTTP errors. Includes dedicated dashboard page at `/errors/actioncable_health_summary` with channel breakdown, rejection counts, and time range filtering. System health snapshot now captures live connection count and adapter name. Configuration: `enable_actioncable_tracking = true` (requires `enable_breadcrumbs = true`)

### Fixed
- **Flaky swallowed exception tracker specs** — Eliminated TracePoint state leakage where RSpec internals (e.g., `Errno::ENOENT` from tempfile.rb) accumulated in counters between tests. Fixed by disabling TracePoint before asserting empty state in all three vulnerable specs

---

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Mute/unmute errors for notification suppression** — Muted errors still appear in the dashboard but skip all notifications (Slack, email, Discord, PagerDuty, webhooks). Includes mute/unmute buttons on error detail page, batch mute/unmute, "Hide muted" filter, and bell-slash icon in error list (#92) @j4rs
- **Comprehensive mute feature test coverage** — LogError notification suppression specs, ErrorsList filter specs, BatchMuteErrors/BatchUnmuteErrors specs, system test for mute/unmute workflow
- Added @j4rs to contributors (first community feature contribution for notification suppression)

### Changed
- **Migrated docs site to Jekyll VitePress Theme** — Replaced jekyll-theme-hacker with [jekyll-vitepress-theme](https://jekyll-vitepress.dev/) by [@crmne](https://github.com/crmne). New docs feature sidebar navigation, dark/light mode, full-text search (`/` or `Ctrl+K`), code copy buttons, edit-on-GitHub links, and previous/next page navigation. Docs reorganized into collections (Getting Started, Guides, Features, Reference)
- **Refactored notification dispatch in LogError** — Extracted `maybe_notify` helper to consolidate mute check + throttle check in a single place (#92) @j4rs

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **GitHub Pages 404s on all documentation links** — Added Jekyll front matter with `permalink` to all 32 documentation files across `docs/`, `docs/guides/`, `docs/features/`, and `docs/development/`. Navigation now includes Features and Troubleshooting entries (#87, #90) @RafaelTurtle

### Changed
- Updated all documentation for v0.4.0 features (FEATURES.md, CONFIGURATION.md, FAQ.md, QUICKSTART.md, API_REFERENCE.md, MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md, GLOSSARY.md, CUSTOMIZATION.md, SETTINGS.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md, TESTING.md, SOURCE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md)
- Added screenshots for local variables, swallowed exceptions, and diagnostic dumps to README
- README updated with 6 new v0.4.0 feature sections
- Added @RafaelTurtle to contributors (first Documentation Hero)

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Local variable capture via TracePoint(:raise)** — Capture local variables at the point of exception. Opt-in via `config.enable_local_variables = true`. Configurable limits for count, depth, string length, array/hash items. Sensitive data auto-filtered via Rails `filter_parameters` + custom patterns. Never stores Binding objects
- **Instance variable capture via TracePoint(:raise)** — Capture instance variables from the object that raised the exception. Opt-in via `config.enable_instance_variables = true`. Includes `_self_class` metadata showing the receiver's class name. Configurable max count and filter patterns
- **Swallowed exception detection via TracePoint(:raise) + TracePoint(:rescue)** — Detect exceptions that are raised but silently rescued (never reach the dashboard). Tracks raise/rescue counts per location, hourly bucketing, configurable flush interval and threshold. Requires Ruby 3.3+. Opt-in via `config.detect_swallowed_exceptions = true`. Dashboard page at `/errors/swallowed_exceptions`
- **On-demand diagnostic dump** — Capture system state snapshots (environment, GC stats, threads, connection pool, memory, job queue) via dashboard button or `rails error_dashboard:diagnostic_dump` rake task. Stored in dedicated table with optional notes. Dashboard page at `/errors/diagnostic_dumps` with expandable JSON details
- **Rack Attack event tracking** — Track Rack::Attack throttle, blocklist, and track events as breadcrumbs. Opt-in via `config.enable_rack_attack_tracking = true` (requires breadcrumbs enabled). Dashboard page at `/errors/rack_attack_summary`
- **Process crash capture via at_exit hook** — Capture unhandled exceptions that crash the Ruby process, logged before exit
- **RubyVM cache health stats** — System health snapshots now include `RubyVM.stat` data (constant cache, class serial, global state) when available
- **YJIT runtime stats** — System health snapshots now include `RubyVM::YJIT.runtime_stats` (compiled ISEQs, code region size, inline/outlined bytes) when YJIT is enabled

### Fixed
- **Swallowed exceptions page always empty** — Query grouped by `(exception_class, raise_location, rescue_location)` but raise and rescue events are stored as separate rows (raise has `rescue_location=nil`, rescue has it set). The ratio was always 0 or infinity. Fixed by grouping on `(exception_class, raise_location)` only
- **Diagnostic dump "Capture Dump" button broken** — Used `link_to` with `method: :post` which requires JavaScript (rails-ujs/Turbo) to intercept clicks. The gem dashboard includes neither, so the browser sent a plain GET matching `errors/:id`. Fixed by using `button_to` which renders a real `<form>`
- **Migration class name mismatch** — `CreateRailsErrorDashboardSwallowedException` (singular) didn't match the filename convention (plural), causing `rails db:migrate` to fail for apps installing the incremental migration
- **Flaky swallowed exception tracker spec on Ruby 3.3+** — TracePoint was globally active between tests, allowing RSpec internals to accumulate raise/rescue counts. Added explicit `clear!` before the empty-counters assertion
- **N+1 queries and memory bloat in DashboardStats** — Eliminated N+1 queries and excessive memory usage in dashboard statistics calculations

### Changed
- README rewritten as a concise landing page (~360 lines, down from 1060)
- Added FAQ and Migration Strategy to documentation hub

---

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Job Health page** — Aggregate view of background job queue stats (Sidekiq, SolidQueue, GoodJob) across errors, sorted by failed count. Summary cards (errors with job data, total failed, adapters detected), adapter badges, color-coded failed counts, 7/30/90 day filtering. Available at `/errors/job_health_summary` when `enable_system_health` is enabled
- **Database Health page** — PgHero-style database health panel with two sections. **Live stats:** connection pool (all adapters), PostgreSQL table sizes/scans/dead tuples/vacuum timestamps from `pg_stat_user_tables`, unused indexes from `pg_stat_user_indexes`, connection activity from `pg_stat_activity`. Host app vs gem tables separated. **Historical:** per-error connection pool utilization from `system_health` snapshots, color-coded (>=80% danger, >=60% warning), sorted by stress score. Available at `/errors/database_health_summary` when `enable_system_health` is enabled
- **RSpec request spec generator** — `rails generate rails_error_dashboard:rspec_request_specs` generates request specs for all dashboard endpoints with copy-to-clipboard button on the settings page
- **Sidebar navigation** — Two new links (Job Health, DB Health) in the sidebar under the system health feature guard
- New service: `Services::DatabaseHealthInspector` — display-time only (not capture path), feature-detects PostgreSQL, every method individually rescue-wrapped
- New query classes: `Queries::JobHealthSummary`, `Queries::DatabaseHealthSummary`
- 34 new specs (13 DatabaseHealthInspector service, 11 DatabaseHealthSummary query, 10 request). Total suite: 2,226 specs

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **Flexible authentication via lambda (#85)** — `config.authenticate_with` lets you use Devise, Warden, session-based, or any custom auth instead of HTTP Basic Auth. The lambda runs in controller context via `instance_exec`, with access to `warden`, `session`, `request`, `params`, `cookies`, and `redirect_to`. Fail-closed: exceptions are rescued, logged, and result in 403 Forbidden
- **Deprecation Warnings page** — Aggregate view of all deprecation warnings across errors, grouped by message and source, with occurrence counts, affected error links, and time range filtering (7/30/90 days). Available at `/errors/deprecations` when breadcrumbs are enabled
- **N+1 Query Patterns page** — Cross-error view of N+1 query patterns grouped by SQL fingerprint, showing total occurrences, affected errors, cumulative query time, and sample queries. Available at `/errors/n_plus_one_summary` when breadcrumbs are enabled
- **Cache Health page** — Per-error cache performance overview sorted worst-first, showing hit rate, read/write counts, slowest operations, and total cache time. Available at `/errors/cache_health_summary` when breadcrumbs are enabled
- **Sidebar navigation** — Three new links (Deprecations, N+1 Queries, Cache Health) in the sidebar under the breadcrumbs feature guard
- **Per-error N+1 tips** — Eager loading suggestions with extracted table names on the error detail N+1 card
- **Per-error cache advisories** — Hit rate advisory alerts on the error detail cache card when hit rate is below 80%
- **Guide links** — Rails Upgrade Guide, Eager Loading Guide, and Caching Guide links on both per-error cards and aggregate pages
- **`extract_table_from_sql` helper** — Extracts table name from SQL queries for contextual eager loading tips
- New query classes: `Queries::DeprecationWarnings`, `Queries::NplusOneSummary`, `Queries::CacheHealthSummary`
- 39 new specs (12 DeprecationWarnings query, 12 NplusOneSummary query, 12 CacheHealthSummary query, 7 N+1 request, 8 cache request, 7 deprecations request, +3 helper specs). Total suite: 2,148 specs

---

## [0.2.4] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **Separate database migration path (#83):** Install generator now copies migrations to `db/error_dashboard_migrate/` when separate database mode is selected — previously always copied to `db/migrate/` regardless of database mode
- **Install crash with separate database (#83):** Replaced `rails_command` migration copier with direct file copy — the old approach booted the app during install, which crashed with `AdapterNotSpecified` because `database.yml` wasn't configured yet
- **Engine boot guard (#83):** The engine's `connects_to` initializer now gracefully skips with a log warning if the database config isn't in `database.yml` yet, instead of crashing the app
- **MySQL foreign key type mismatch (#84):** Changed 5 foreign key columns in the squashed migration from `t.integer` to `t.bigint` — MySQL/Trilogy enforces strict FK type matching and rejected the `integer` FK referencing a `bigint` PK. Affected columns: `error_logs.application_id`, `error_occurrences.error_log_id`, `cascade_patterns.parent_error_id`, `cascade_patterns.child_error_id`, `error_comments.error_log_id`

### Improved
- **Shared database install UX:** The installer now asks whether this is the first app or joining an existing shared database, and accepts the existing database name (with automatic environment suffix stripping)

---

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **Error detail page crash (cause chain):** Fixed `undefined method 'each' for an instance of String` when cause chain backtrace data is stored as a string instead of an array — the view now coerces strings to arrays before iterating

---

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **Error detail page crash:** Fixed 500 error on the show page when cascade patterns have NULL `cascade_probability` or `avg_delay_seconds` values — added nil guards in the view (#80)

---

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- **PostgreSQL migration fix:** Added `disable_ddl_transaction!` to `add_time_series_indexes_to_error_logs` migration — `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` cannot run inside a transaction block (#75)
- **Reopened filter persistence:** Fixed reopened quick filter being lost when unchecking "Unresolved only" and applying filters (#73)
- **Flaky test fix:** Fixed notification dispatcher spec that could fail depending on test ordering

### Added
- **Loading states & skeleton screens:** Added Stimulus-powered loading indicators, skeleton placeholders for dashboard stats and error lists, and button loading states (#71) @midwire
- **Regression test:** Added spec to verify `disable_ddl_transaction!` is declared on the time-series indexes migration

### Changed
- **Upgrade guide:** Added v0.2.0 upgrade instructions to `docs/MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md` with step-by-step guidance for separate database users (#76)
- **Contributors:** Added @midwire to CONTRIBUTORS.md and README.md for backtrace line numbers (#69) and loading states (#71)
- **Docs cleanup:** Removed 18 obsolete v0.1.x test reports and internal notes, updated version references across all documentation to v0.2.0

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- Add line numbers to backtrace frames in error detail view (#69) @midwire

### v0.2 Quick Wins

#### 🔗 Exception Cause Chain Capture

Automatically walk the full exception `cause` chain and store it as structured JSON. When a `SocketError` causes a `RuntimeError`, you'll see both — not just the wrapper.

- Stores each cause's class name, message, and backtrace
- Displayed on the error detail page with collapsible cause chain viewer
- New `exception_cause` text column on `error_logs`

#### 🌐 Enriched Error Context

Every HTTP error now captures richer request context automatically:

- `http_method` — GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- `hostname` — the server that handled the request
- `content_type` — request content type
- `request_duration_ms` — how long the request took before it errored

No configuration needed — captured automatically from the Rack environment.

#### 🔑 Custom Fingerprint Lambda

Override the default error grouping with your own logic:

```ruby
config.custom_fingerprint = ->(exception, context) {
  case exception
  when ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
    "record-not-found-#{context[:controller]}"
  else
    nil # fall back to default fingerprinting
  end
}
```

Return `nil` to use the default fingerprint, or return a string to group errors your way.

#### 👤 CurrentAttributes Integration

Automatically captures `Current.user`, `Current.account`, `Current.request_id` (and any other attributes) from your `ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes` subclasses. Zero configuration — if you use `Current`, we capture it.

#### ⚡ BRIN Indexes for Time-Series Performance

Added PostgreSQL BRIN index on `occurred_at` for dramatically faster time-range queries:

- 72KB index vs 676MB B-tree on large tables
- Functional index on `DATE(occurred_at)` for 70x faster Groupdate queries
- Falls back to standard B-tree indexes on MySQL/SQLite

#### 📦 Reduced Dependencies

Made 4 runtime dependencies optional instead of required:

- `browser` — only needed if platform detection is used
- `chartkick` — only needed for chart rendering
- `httparty` — only needed for webhook/Slack/Discord/PagerDuty notifications
- `turbo-rails` — only needed for real-time Turbo Stream updates

Core gem now requires only `rails` and `pagy`.

#### 🔍 Structured Backtrace Parsing

Uses `backtrace_locations` (when available) for richer backtrace data with proper `path`, `lineno`, and `label` fields. Falls back to string parsing for exceptions that only provide string backtraces.

#### 🖥️ Environment Info Capture

Automatically captures the runtime environment at error time:

- Ruby version, Rails version
- Key gem versions (puma, sidekiq, etc.)
- Server software (Puma, Unicorn, Passenger)
- Database adapter (postgresql, mysql2, sqlite3)

Stored as JSON in the `environment_info` column. Displayed on the error detail page.

#### 🔒 Sensitive Data Filtering

Automatically filters passwords, tokens, secrets, and API keys from error context before storage:

- Default patterns: `password`, `token`, `secret`, `api_key`, `authorization`, `credit_card`, `ssn`
- Configurable pattern list via `config.sensitive_data_patterns`
- Enable/disable with `config.filter_sensitive_data` (enabled by default)
- Replaces sensitive values with `[FILTERED]`

#### 🔄 Auto-Reopen on Recurrence

When a resolved error recurs, it automatically reopens instead of staying resolved:

- Sets `reopened_at` timestamp and clears `resolved` status
- Increments occurrence count
- Visual "Reopened" badge in the dashboard UI
- New `reopened_at` datetime column on `error_logs`

#### 🔕 Notification Throttling

Three layers of notification control to prevent alert fatigue:

- **Severity filter** — `config.notification_minimum_severity` (default: `:low`) — skip notifications for low-severity errors
- **Per-error cooldown** — `config.notification_cooldown_minutes` (default: `5`) — don't re-notify for the same error within the cooldown window
- **Threshold alerts** — `config.notification_threshold_alerts` (default: `[10, 50, 100, 500, 1000]`) — get milestone notifications when an error hits occurrence thresholds

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Guard `turbo_stream_from` against missing ActionCable in host apps that use Turbo but don't load ActionCable engine
- Add `backtrace_locations` and `cause` to `SyntheticException` for testing
- Fix Phase H chaos test connection check for SQLite compatibility (`active?` returns `nil` on SQLite)

#### 🧪 Testing

- 1,826+ RSpec specs (up from 1,300+), 0 pending
- Added system tests for v0.2 quick wins UI features
- Added Phase G chaos tests for v0.2 quick wins
- Added unit, system, and chaos tests for database setup features
- Enhanced installer with 3 database modes and verify rake task
- **New: 8-app release audit** (`bin/pre-release-test release_audit`) — comprehensive pre-release validation
  - Kitchen Sink: every config option enabled simultaneously (Phase K)
  - Multi-App: two Rails apps sharing one error database (Phase I)
  - SolidQueue: async logging via `:solid_queue` adapter path
  - Upgrade Path: v0.1.38 → v0.2.0 migration verification (Phases J0/J)

---

## [0.1.38] - 2026-02-18

### ⬆️ Dependencies

**Upgrade Pagy from ~> 9.0 to ~> 43.0**

Pagy 43 is a complete redesign with a new simplified API. Updated all integration points:

- `Pagy::Backend`/`Pagy::Frontend` replaced with unified `Pagy::Method`
- `pagy(query, items:)` replaced with `pagy(:offset, query, limit:)`
- `pagy_info(@pagy)` replaced with `@pagy.info_tag`
- `pagy_bootstrap_nav(@pagy)` replaced with `@pagy.series_nav(:bootstrap)`
- `Pagy::OverflowError`/`Pagy::VariableError` replaced with `Pagy::RangeError`/`Pagy::OptionError`
- Bootstrap extras now built-in (no separate `require "pagy/extras/bootstrap"`)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fix flaky `backtrace_limiting_spec` caused by dummy app config leaking `max_backtrace_lines = 50` into tests expecting the default of 100. Added `reset_configuration!` to the `before` block so tests always start from a clean default state regardless of random execution order.

---

## [0.1.37] - 2026-02-12

### ♻️ Refactoring

**Complete CQRS Architecture Refactor (Phases 1-17)**

Restructured the entire codebase from a model-heavy architecture to clean CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):

- **Commands** (17 files) — All write operations extracted from models: `LogError`, `FindOrIncrementError`, `FindOrCreateApplication`, `ResolveError`, `AssignError`, `BatchResolveErrors`, `UpsertBaseline`, `UpsertCascadePattern`, and more
- **Queries** (13 files) — All read operations: `ErrorsList`, `DashboardStats`, `AnalyticsStats`, `SimilarErrors`, `ErrorCorrelation`, `PlatformComparison`, `BaselineStats`, and more
- **Services** (25+ files) — Pure algorithms with no database access: `SeverityClassifier`, `PriorityScoreCalculator`, `ErrorHashGenerator`, `ErrorNormalizer`, `BacktraceProcessor`, `CascadeDetector`, `ErrorBroadcaster`, `AnalyticsCacheManager`, all notification payload builders, and more

Every service is a pure function, every command handles a single write concern, and every query is composable and side-effect-free.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fix `Float::Infinity`, `Float::NaN`, and non-numeric inputs in `frequency_to_score` causing crashes
- Fix defensive guards and edge case handling across refactored services (Phases 12-17)
- Fix 3 issues found during chaos testing in production mode
- Fix flaky CI by resetting configuration before `dashboard_url` test
- Fix RuboCop lint failures (array bracket spacing, trailing commas)
- Fix cross-platform `sed -i` incompatibility in integration test route injection (macOS vs Linux)

### 🧪 Testing

- **Full integration test suite** (`bin/full-integration-test`) — Spins up 2 fresh Rails apps in production mode (shared DB + separate DB), installs the gem with all features ON, seeds diverse test data, and runs 272 HTTP-level assertions covering every dashboard page, action, filter, edge case, and error capture path with CSRF-aware form submissions
- **Chaos tests** added to lefthook pre-commit hooks — 4 integration scenarios (~1000+ assertions) run before every commit
- Added integration tests to CI pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Cleaned up dead specs

### 🧹 Maintenance

- Exclude bash scripts from RuboCop linting
- Delete dead code identified during refactoring

## [0.1.36] - 2026-02-10

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Fix NoMethodError crashes on overview and error detail pages** 🔧

Two dashboard pages crashed with `NoMethodError` when advanced features were enabled:

1. **Overview page** — `no implicit conversion of Symbol into Integer` when time-correlated errors existed. The template iterated `@time_correlated_errors` as an array, but `ErrorCorrelation#time_correlated_errors` returns a hash of `{key => {error_type_a:, error_type_b:, correlation:, strength:}}` pairs.

2. **Error detail page** — `undefined method 'repository_url'` when viewing an error with comments and `git_repository_url` configured. The `auto_link_urls` helper called `error.application.repository_url`, but the `Application` model has no `repository_url` column. Added `respond_to?` guard to fall back to the global config.

**Fix Ruby 4.0 compatibility** 💎

Replaced `OpenStruct` usage in test factory with `Struct` — `ostruct` was removed from Ruby 4.0's stdlib. Added `save!` stub for FactoryBot `create()` compatibility.

### 🧪 Tests

- Added `spec/helpers/application_helper_spec.rb` with 13 specs covering `auto_link_urls`: blank input, URL linking, inline code highlighting, file path GitHub linking, error parameter handling (the bug fix), and HTML escaping in code blocks.

**Commits:** `f2562fb`

## [0.1.35] - 2026-02-10

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Fix CSS/JS not loading in production (Thruster compatibility)** 🎨

Dashboard CSS and JavaScript files were returning 404 in production when the host app uses Thruster (Rails 8 default proxy). The navbar, sidebar styling, dark mode, and all interactive features were completely broken.

**Root Cause:**
- CSS/JS files were in the engine's `public/` directory, served via `ActionDispatch::Static` middleware
- The `public/` directory was never included in the gemspec, so files didn't ship with the gem
- Even if they did, Thruster intercepts static file requests before they reach Rails middleware

**What's Fixed:**
- Inlined all CSS and JS directly into the layout ERB (same approach used pre-v0.1.29 that worked everywhere)
- Removed `ActionDispatch::Static` middleware from engine.rb (no longer needed)
- Removed broken `highlightjs-line-numbers.js` CSS CDN link (MIME type mismatch)
- Deleted external `public/rails_error_dashboard/` directory

**Result:** Dashboard is now fully self-contained — works with Thruster, Puma, Nginx, any proxy setup, zero asset pipeline dependency.

## [0.1.34] - 2026-02-10

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Fix Thor `:light_black` Color Crash in Generators** 🎨

The install and uninstall generators crashed with `NameError: uninitialized constant Thor::Shell::Color::LIGHT_BLACK` when run in a terminal. Thor doesn't define a `:light_black` color constant.

**What's Fixed:**
- Replaced all 16 occurrences of `:light_black` with `:white` across both generators
- Install generator (`rails generate rails_error_dashboard:install`) no longer crashes
- Uninstall generator (`rails generate rails_error_dashboard:uninstall`) no longer crashes

**Note:** The bug only surfaced in real terminals (TTY) because Thor silently skips color lookup in non-TTY environments (CI/pipes), which is why it wasn't caught in tests.

**Fixes:** [#60](https://github.com/AnjanJ/rails_error_dashboard/issues/60)
**Commit:** `537fb1d`

**Commit:** `b504b18`

---

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Improved Color Contrast in Settings Page** 🎨

Fixed readability issues with yellow backgrounds in both light and dark themes.

**What's Fixed:**
- Performance Settings header: yellow → dark gray (better contrast)
- Advanced Configuration header: yellow → gray (better contrast)
- Data Retention warning text: yellow → red (readable in light theme)
- Warning badge: added dark text for better readability

**Before:**
- Yellow text on white (light theme) - poor contrast
- White text on yellow (dark theme) - unreadable

**After:**
- Readable in both light and dark themes
- WCAG compliant color contrast ratios

**Commit:** `b64aa81`

---

**Fixed Empty Chart.js Resolution Time Display** 📈

Fixed Chart.js v4 compatibility issue causing empty "Average Resolution Time" chart on Platform Health page.

**What's Fixed:**
- Changed deprecated `type: 'horizontalBar'` to `type: 'bar'` with `indexAxis: 'y'`
- Chart.js v4 removed `horizontalBar` type in favor of indexAxis option
- Platform Health page now correctly displays resolution time charts

**Commit:** `537622d` (included in overview page enhancement)

---

**CRITICAL: Multi-Database Support Fixed**

**CRITICAL: Multi-Database Support Fixed**

Fixed a critical bug that broke multi-database support completely. The `Application` model was incorrectly inheriting from `ActiveRecord::Base` instead of `ErrorLogsRecord`, causing it to query the wrong database.

**Impact:**
- Affected ALL users attempting to use separate databases (v0.1.23-v0.1.28)
- Affected multi-app shared database setups
- Caused "Could not find table 'rails_error_dashboard_applications'" errors

**Fix:**
- `Application` model now correctly inherits from `ErrorLogsRecord`
- Multi-database routing now works as intended
- Database isolation properly enforced

**Testing:**
- Verified with fresh install using separate database
- Verified with shared database across multiple apps
- All CRUD operations confirmed working
- Comprehensive test suite created

**Files Changed:**
- `app/models/rails_error_dashboard/application.rb` - Changed base class inheritance

**Commit:** `d83f8aa`

If you experienced issues with multi-database setup in v0.1.23-v0.1.28, please upgrade to this version.

### ✨ Features

**Auto-Detection of User Model, Total Users, and Application Settings** 🤖

The dashboard now automatically detects your User model, total users count, application name, and database configuration without manual setup.

**What's New:**
- **Application Name Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects from `Rails.application.class.module_parent_name`
  - Shows with green "Auto-detected" badge when not manually configured

## [0.1.29] - 2026-01-22

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Export JSON Button Fixed** 📥

Fixed multiple issues with the Export JSON button on error detail pages that prevented it from working correctly.

**Problems:**
1. `ReferenceError: downloadErrorJSON is not defined` - Function was defined after the button element
2. `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '&'` - Double-escaping issue in JavaScript context
3. Function couldn't be called due to incorrect placement in HTML

**Solutions:**
1. **Function Placement**: Moved `<script>` tag with `downloadErrorJSON()` function to the top of the file (before the button element)
   - Ensures function is defined before the onclick handler tries to call it
   - Prevents ReferenceError on button click
2. **Escaping Fix**: Changed from `json_escape` to `raw` for JSON data in script context
   - `json_escape` output was being HTML-escaped again in ERB, turning quotes into `&quot;` entities
   - Using `raw` is safe here because `.to_json` already properly escapes for JSON context
   - Prevents JavaScript syntax errors from malformed JSON

**Impact:**
- Export JSON button now works correctly on all error detail pages
- Downloads properly formatted JSON file with error details
- No more console errors when clicking the button

**Files Changed:**
- `app/views/rails_error_dashboard/errors/show.html.erb`

---

**User Filter Links Fixed & DRYed Up** 🔗

Fixed broken user filter links on Correlation page and eliminated code duplication between Analytics and Correlation pages.

**Problem:**
- Correlation page's "View" button for multi-error users was passing `search=User+%2336` instead of filtering by user_id
- This searched error messages instead of filtering by the specific user
- Analytics page had the correct implementation with `user_id` filter
- Both pages had nearly identical user table HTML (74 lines of duplicate code)

**Solution:**
1. **Fixed Correlation Link**: Changed from `errors_path(search: user_data[:user_email])` to `errors_path(user_id: user_data[:user_id])`
2. **Created Shared Partial**: Extracted user table into `_user_errors_table.html.erb` with configurable columns:
   - `show_rank`: Shows ranking numbers (Analytics)
   - `show_error_type_count`: Shows distinct error types (Correlation)
   - `show_percentage`: Shows percentage bar (Analytics)
   - `show_error_types`: Shows error type badges (Correlation)

**Impact:**
- User filter links work correctly from both Analytics and Correlation pages
- 74 lines of duplicate code eliminated
- Single source of truth for user table rendering
- Future fixes automatically apply to both pages
- Consistent user filtering behavior across dashboard

**Files Changed:**
- `app/views/rails_error_dashboard/errors/correlation.html.erb`
- `app/views/rails_error_dashboard/errors/analytics.html.erb`
- `app/views/rails_error_dashboard/errors/_user_errors_table.html.erb` (new)

---

**Analytics "View Errors" Links Fixed** 👁️

Fixed multiple issues with "View Errors" links from Analytics page that were showing incorrect data.

**Problems:**
1. Links were passing `search` parameter instead of `user_id`, searching error text instead of filtering by user
2. Default filter behavior was inconsistent - sometimes showing all errors, sometimes only unresolved
3. Users couldn't see resolved errors when investigating from Analytics

**Solutions:**
1. **User Filter Fix**: Changed from `search` to `user_id` parameter for precise user filtering
2. **Unresolved Filter Fix**: Explicitly pass `unresolved=false` to show both resolved and unresolved errors
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Analytics links now show complete error history for better investigation

**Impact:**
- "View Errors" links from Analytics page now show the correct filtered error list
- Users can see full error history (both resolved and unresolved) when investigating from Analytics
- More intuitive workflow for error investigation

**Files Changed:**
- `app/views/rails_error_dashboard/errors/analytics.html.erb`
- `lib/rails_error_dashboard/queries/errors_list.rb`
- `spec/queries/rails_error_dashboard/queries/errors_list_spec.rb`

### ✨ Features

**Solution:**
- Changed text color from `text-dark` to `text-body` for better contrast
- Maintains readability across both light and dark themes

**Impact:**
- Better accessibility for users in light theme
- Status badges easier to read

**Files Changed:**
- `app/views/rails_error_dashboard/errors/show.html.erb`

## [0.1.27] - 2025-01-12

### 🔒 Security

**XSS Vulnerability Fix in Error JSON Download** 🛡️

Fixed stored XSS vulnerability where malicious error data could execute arbitrary JavaScript via script tag breakout attack.

**Vulnerability Details:**
- Error detail page had a "Download JSON" feature that embedded error data in JavaScript
- Used unsafe `raw` helper with `.to_json`, which doesn't escape forward slashes by default
- Malicious error messages containing `</script><script>alert('XSS')</script>` could break out of script tags and execute arbitrary JavaScript

**Fix:**
- Replaced all `raw @error.X.to_json` with `json_escape @error.X.to_json` in error detail view
- `json_escape` properly escapes `</` as `<\/`, preventing script tag breakout attacks
- Maintains valid JavaScript syntax while preventing XSS

**Impact:**
- Prevents XSS attacks via malicious error data
- Error JSON download functionality works correctly
- Proper JSON data types preserved (numbers, booleans, strings)

**Security Advisory:**
- Severity: Medium
- Attack Vector: Stored XSS via error logging
- Affected Versions: All versions prior to 0.1.27
- Recommendation: Update to 0.1.27 or later immediately

**Thanks to @gundestrup for discovering and fixing this vulnerability!** 🙏

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**App Switcher Visibility** 🔄

Fixed issue where app switcher was only appearing on the index page, not on other dashboard pages.

**Problem:**
- App switcher dropdown was missing on Analytics, Platform Comparison, Error Correlation pages
- Users couldn't switch applications when viewing these pages
- Had to navigate back to index page to change app context

**Solution:**
- Moved `@applications` initialization from `index` action to `set_application_context` before_action
- This ensures all controller actions have access to the applications list
- App switcher now appears consistently on every page

**Impact:**
- App switcher visible on all dashboard pages (Overview, Index, Analytics, Platform Comparison, Error Correlation)
- Consistent UX across the entire dashboard
- Users can switch app context from any page

**Files Changed:**
- `app/controllers/rails_error_dashboard/errors_controller.rb`
- `app/views/rails_error_dashboard/errors/show.html.erb`

## [0.1.26] - 2025-01-11

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Navigation Context Persistence** 🔗

Fixed issue where application_id parameter was not preserved when navigating between pages.

**Problem:**
- When selecting an application via the app switcher, the context was lost when navigating to different pages (Overview, Analytics, Settings)
- Users had to re-select the application on each page
- Poor UX for multi-app deployments

**Solution:**
- Updated sidebar navigation links to preserve `application_id` parameter across all page navigation
- Added `nav_params` helper to extract and maintain application context
- Quick filter links now merge application_id with filter parameters

**Impact:**
- Application context now persists across all dashboard pages
- Consistent multi-app experience
- No need to re-select application when navigating

**Files Changed:**
- `app/views/layouts/rails_error_dashboard.html.erb`

**Multi-App Context Filtering** 🎯

Implemented comprehensive app-context filtering across all dashboard pages and operations.

**What's New:**

1. **Consistent Application Context**
   - When an application is selected, ALL data is now filtered to that app only
   - App context persists across all pages: Overview, Index, Analytics, Platform Comparison, Error Correlation
   - Related errors, comments, and all operations respect the selected app context

2. **Controller-Level Pattern**
   - Added `before_action :set_application_context` to establish consistent app filtering
   - Uses `@current_application_id` from URL params (`?application_id=X`)
   - "All Apps" is default when no application_id is specified

3. **Query Object Updates**
   - Updated 5 query objects to accept and respect `application_id` parameter:
     - `PlatformComparison` - Added `base_scope` method
     - `ErrorCorrelation` - Updated `base_query` to filter by application
     - `RecurringIssues` - Updated `base_query` to filter by application

## [0.1.24] - 2025-01-11

### 🔒 Security Release

This release addresses mass assignment vulnerabilities identified by Brakeman security scanner.

#### Security

**1. Mass Assignment Vulnerability Fix** 🔐

Fixed 4 medium-confidence Brakeman warnings related to `params.permit!` usage:
- **Issue:** Using `params.permit!` allows any parameters to pass through, creating potential security vulnerabilities
- **Impact:** Malicious users could potentially inject unauthorized parameters
- **Fix:** Implemented explicit parameter whitelisting throughout the application

**Changes:**

1. **Added Parameter Whitelist Constant** (`app/controllers/rails_error_dashboard/errors_controller.rb`)
   ```ruby
   FILTERABLE_PARAMS = %i[
     error_type unresolved platform application_id search
     severity timeframe frequency status assigned_to
     priority_level hide_snoozed sort_by sort_direction
   ].freeze
   ```

2. **Created Secure Helper Method** (`app/helpers/rails_error_dashboard/application_helper.rb`)
   ```ruby
   def permitted_filter_params(extra_keys: [])
     base_keys = ErrorsController::FILTERABLE_PARAMS + %i[page per_page days]
     allowed_keys = base_keys + Array(extra_keys)
     params.permit(*allowed_keys).to_h.symbolize_keys
   end
   ```

3. **Replaced All `params.permit!` Calls**
   - Controller: Updated `filter_params` method to use explicit permit
   - Helper: Updated `sortable_header` to use `permitted_filter_params`
   - Views: Updated application switcher and filter pills to use secure parameters

**Files Changed:**
- `app/controllers/rails_error_dashboard/errors_controller.rb` - Whitelist constant and secure filter_params
- `app/helpers/rails_error_dashboard/application_helper.rb` - New permitted_filter_params helper
- `app/views/layouts/rails_error_dashboard.html.erb` - Secure application switcher
- `app/views/rails_error_dashboard/errors/index.html.erb` - Secure filter pills

**Security Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminates all 4 Brakeman mass assignment warnings
- ✅ Prevents unauthorized parameter injection
- ✅ Follows Rails security best practices
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility

**2. Dependency Security Update** 🔒

Updated `httparty` dependency to address CVE-2025-68696:
- **Issue:** Potential SSRF vulnerability that could lead to API key leakage
- **Before:** `httparty ~> 0.21` (v0.23.2)
- **After:** `httparty >= 0.24.0`
- **Impact:** Eliminates SSRF vulnerability in HTTP client library
- **Breaking:** None - httparty 0.24.0 is backward compatible

---

## [0.1.23] - 2025-01-10

### ✅ Production-Ready Release

This release completes the v0.1.22 hotfix cycle with **100% CI coverage** and comprehensive integration testing across all deployment scenarios.

#### Fixed

**1. Rails 7.x Schema Compatibility (CI Database Failures)**
- **Issue:** CI failing on Rails 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 with database setup errors
- **Root Cause:** `ActiveRecord::Schema[8.0]` syntax incompatible with Rails 7.x
- **Fix:** Changed to `ActiveRecord::Schema.define` for universal compatibility
- **File:** `spec/dummy/db/schema.rb`
- **Impact:** All 15 Ruby/Rails combinations now pass CI (Rails 7.0-8.1 × Ruby 3.2-3.4)

**2. Ruby 3.2 Cache-Related Test Failures**
- **Issue:** 2 tests failing on Ruby 3.2 with transactional fixture rollbacks
- **Root Cause:** Caching ActiveRecord objects caused stale object references after test rollbacks
- **Fix:** Changed from caching objects to caching IDs with stale cache detection
- **File:** `app/models/rails_error_dashboard/application.rb`
- **Technical Details:**
  - Changed cache key from `error_dashboard/application/#{name}` to `error_dashboard/application_id/#{name}`
  - Cache now stores ID instead of object: `Rails.cache.write(..., found.id, expires_in: 1.hour)`
  - Added stale cache cleanup: detects when cached ID no longer exists in database
  - Prevents transactional rollback issues with cached object references
- **Impact:** Tests pass reliably across all Ruby versions (3.2, 3.3, 3.4)

**3. Test Isolation Issues (Configuration Pollution)**
- **Issue:** Tests passing in isolation but failing with certain random seeds (53830, 52580)
- **Root Cause:** Configuration state pollution between tests
  - `async_logging` enabled by previous tests → LogError returns Job instead of logging
  - `sampling_rate < 1.0` set by previous tests → errors skipped randomly
- **Fix:** Enhanced test setup to reset configuration state
- **Files:** `spec/features/multi_app_support_spec.rb`
- **Technical Details:**
  ```ruby
  before do
    Rails.cache.clear
    RailsErrorDashboard.configuration.sampling_rate = 1.0
    RailsErrorDashboard.configuration.async_logging = false  # Critical fix
  end
  ```
- **Impact:** Tests pass consistently regardless of random seed

#### Improvements

**1. Cache Architecture Enhancement**
- **Before:** Cached ActiveRecord objects directly (anti-pattern)
- **After:** Cache only IDs, fetch objects from database (best practice)
- **Benefits:**
  - Prevents stale object references
  - Works correctly with transactional fixtures
  - More reliable in production
  - Automatic stale cache detection and cleanup

**2. Test Configuration Management**
- Changed from stubbing to direct configuration assignment (more reliable)
- Added explicit configuration cleanup in `after` blocks
- Prevents test pollution across random seeds

#### Comprehensive Integration Testing

All installation and upgrade scenarios validated through:

**Scenario 1: Fresh Install - Single Database**
- ✅ Generator with `--no-interactive`
- ✅ 18 migrations execute successfully
- ✅ Application auto-registration works
- ✅ Error logging with `application_id` association

**Scenario 2: Fresh Install - Multi Database**
- ✅ Multi-database `database.yml` configuration
- ✅ Generator with `--separate_database --database=error_dashboard`
- ✅ Both databases created successfully
- ✅ Errors logged to separate database

**Scenario 3: Upgrade Single DB → Single DB**
- ✅ v0.1.21 → v0.1.23 upgrade path
- ✅ Existing errors preserved after upgrade
- ✅ New migrations execute successfully
- ✅ Backfill migrations populate `application_id`

**Scenario 4: Upgrade Single DB → Multi DB**
- ✅ v0.1.21 (single) → v0.1.23 (multi) migration
- ✅ Configuration change to `use_separate_database = true`
- ✅ New errors logged to error_dashboard database
- ✅ Zero code changes required

**Scenario 5: Upgrade Multi DB → Multi DB**
- ✅ v0.1.21 (multi) → v0.1.23 (multi) upgrade
- ✅ Multi-database configuration preserved
- ✅ Existing errors in error_dashboard preserved
- ✅ Seamless upgrade experience

#### Testing & Quality Metrics

## [0.1.22] - 2025-01-08

### 🚀 Major Features

#### Multi-App Support
Rails Error Dashboard now supports multiple Rails applications logging errors to a single shared database with excellent performance and zero concurrency issues.

**Database Architecture:**
- New normalized `applications` table with unique name constraint
- Added `application_id` foreign key to `error_logs` (NOT NULL with index)
- 4-phase zero-downtime migration strategy (nullable → backfill → NOT NULL → FK)
- Composite indexes for performance: `[application_id, occurred_at]`, `[application_id, resolved]`
- Expert-level concurrency design with row-level pessimistic locking

**Auto-Registration:**
- Zero-config: Applications auto-register on first error
- Automatic detection from `Rails.application.class.module_parent_name`
- Manual override via `config.application_name` or `APPLICATION_NAME` env var
- Cached lookups (1-hour TTL) prevent database hits

**UI Features:**
- Navbar app switcher dropdown (only shown with 2+ applications)
- Application filter in error list with active pill display
- Application column in error table (conditional display)
- Progressive disclosure - multi-app features only appear when needed
- Excellent UX with intuitive filtering

**Performance:**
- Per-app cache isolation prevents cross-app cache invalidation
- Row-level locking scoped by `application_id` (no cross-app contention)
- Apps write errors independently without blocking each other
- Per-app error deduplication via `error_hash` including `application_id`

**New Files:**
- `app/models/rails_error_dashboard/application.rb` - Application model
- `lib/tasks/error_dashboard.rake` - 3 rake tasks (list_applications, backfill_application, app_stats)
- 4 migrations for zero-downtime schema changes
- `docs/MULTI_APP_PERFORMANCE.md` - Performance analysis

### 🔒 Security Hardening

#### Authentication Always Required
**BREAKING CHANGE:** Authentication is now always enforced with no bypass option.

- Removed `require_authentication` config option
- Removed `require_authentication_in_development` option
- Authentication now enforced at code level (cannot be disabled)
- No development environment bypass
- Prevents accidental production exposure

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates config-based security vulnerabilities
- Consistent security across all environments
- No risk of accidentally disabling auth in production

**Migration:** Remove these lines from your initializer if present:
```ruby
config.require_authentication = false  # REMOVE
config.require_authentication_in_development = false  # REMOVE
```

### ✨ UI/UX Improvements

#### Light Theme Fixes
Fixed multiple visibility issues in light theme:
- **App Switcher Button**: Fixed invisible white text on light background
- **Dropdown Menus**: Fixed invisible menu items (white on white)
- **Chart Tooltips**: Fixed unreadable dark text on dark background
- Added proper CSS specificity with `!important` overrides
- Tested and verified in both light and dark themes

**Technical Details:**
- Added `.app-switcher-btn` CSS class with theme-aware colors
- Fixed dropdown menu colors for light/dark themes
- Dynamic Chart.js tooltip colors based on theme
- Theme-aware text colors ensure readability

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

#### Fix #1: Analytics Cache Key Bug
**File:** `lib/rails_error_dashboard/queries/analytics_stats.rb:49`

**Issue:** Cache key used `ErrorLog.maximum(:updated_at)` instead of `base_scope.maximum(:updated_at)`

**Impact:**
- Cache not properly isolated per application
- Cache invalidates globally when ANY app's errors change
- Same bug already fixed in `dashboard_stats.rb` but missed here

**Fix:** Changed to `base_scope.maximum(:updated_at)` for proper per-app cache isolation

#### Fix #2: N+1 Query in Rake Task
**File:** `lib/tasks/error_dashboard.rake`

**Issue:** `error_dashboard:list_applications` task made **6N database queries** where N = number of apps
- 10 apps = 60 queries
- 100 apps = 600 queries!

**Fix:** Single SQL query with LEFT JOIN and aggregates
```ruby
# Before: 6N queries
apps.map(&:error_count)  # N queries
apps.map(&:unresolved_error_count)  # N queries
apps.sum(&:error_count)  # 2N queries
apps.sum(&:unresolved_error_count)  # 2N queries

# After: 1 query
apps = Application
  .select('applications.*, COUNT(...) as total_errors, SUM(CASE...) as unresolved_errors')
  .joins('LEFT JOIN error_logs...')
  .group('applications.id')
```

**Performance Improvement:** ~600x faster for 100 apps (600 queries → 1 query)

### 🔧 Code Quality Improvements

#### Previous Fixes (from Initial Code Review)
- Removed orphaned test for `require_authentication`
- Fixed `dashboard_stats` cache key to use `base_scope` for proper isolation
- Simplified redundant conditional in `errors_list` filter
- Standardized logging to use `RailsErrorDashboard::Logger` throughout (5 locations)
- Updated 6 documentation files to remove authentication bypass references

#### Logger Consistency
- Changed all `Rails.logger` calls to `RailsErrorDashboard::Logger`
- Logging now respects `enable_internal_logging` configuration
- Improved error messages with class names and context

### 📚 Documentation

**New Documentation:**
- `CODE_REVIEW_REPORT.md` - Initial comprehensive review (17 issues identified)
- `FIXES_APPLIED.md` - Documentation of 6 major fixes with verification steps
- `ULTRATHINK_ANALYSIS.md` - Deep analysis (12 issues, 2 critical)
- `CRITICAL_FIXES_ULTRATHINK.md` - Documentation of 2 critical performance fixes
- `MULTI_APP_PERFORMANCE.md` - Performance benchmarks and analysis

**Updated Documentation:**

- No per-app cache isolation

**After This Release:**
- Per-app cache isolation (only invalidates relevant app)
- Rake task: 1 query with aggregates (~600x improvement)
- Proper cache keys with `base_scope` filtering

## [0.1.21] - 2025-01-04

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Turbo Helpers Missing in Production** - Fixed `undefined method 'turbo_stream_from'` error
  - Fixed production-only error when accessing error dashboard pages
  - Added explicit `require "turbo-rails"` to ensure helpers are available
  - Resolves initialization order issues in production mode (eager loading)
  - Error was caused by engine loading before host app's Turbo initialization
  - Affects real-time updates feature (`turbo_stream_from "error_list"`)
  - **Impact**: Dashboard now works correctly in production environments
  - **Credit**: Thanks to @bonniesimon for identifying and fixing this issue! 🎉

### Technical Details
- **File modified**: `lib/rails_error_dashboard.rb`
- **Issue**: Production eager loading caused helper unavailability
- **Solution**: Explicitly require turbo-rails alongside other dependencies
- **Related**: Similar to [turbo-rails issue #64](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails/issues/64)
- **Why development worked**: Lazy autoloading masked the problem
- **Why production failed**: Eager loading exposed initialization race condition
- 100% backward compatible - turbo-rails already a required dependency

### Community
- 🎉 **First external contribution** by @bonniesimon
- Properly identified production-only bug
- Clean, minimal fix with excellent documentation
- Followed proper issue → PR workflow

  - Dashboard pages: 300 requests/minute per IP
- **Per-IP Tracking** - Automatic expiration with Rails.cache
- **Configurable** - Opt-in via `config.enable_rate_limiting`
- **Graceful Responses** - Returns 429 Too Many Requests with appropriate message

#### Phase 5: Query Result Caching
- **DashboardStats Caching** - 1-minute TTL
  - Cache key includes last error update timestamp + current hour
- **AnalyticsStats Caching** - 5-minute TTL
  - Cache key includes days parameter + last error update + start date
- **Automatic Cache Invalidation** - Via model callbacks
  - `after_save :clear_analytics_cache`
  - `after_destroy :clear_analytics_cache`
  - Pattern-based clearing with `Rails.cache.delete_matched`
- **Performance Gain**: 70-95% faster on cache hits, 85% database load reduction

#### Phase 6: View Optimization
- **Fragment Caching** - Added to large 45KB show.html.erb view
  - Error details section: `<% cache [@error, 'error_details_v1'] do %>`
  - Request context section: `<% cache [@error, 'request_context_v1'] do %>`
  - Similar errors section: `<% cache [@error, 'similar_errors_v1', similar.maximum(:updated_at)] do %>`
- **Smart Cache Keys** - Version suffixes for easy invalidation
- **Selective Caching** - Did NOT cache frequently changing sections (comments, workflow status)
- **Performance Gain**: 60-80% faster page loads

#### Phase 7: Comprehensive API Documentation
- **Enhanced docs/API_REFERENCE.md** - From 4.5KB to 21KB (847 lines)
- **Complete HTTP API Reference**:
  - Authentication and rate limiting details
  - All dashboard endpoints (list, show, resolve, assign, priority, status, snooze, comments, batch)
  - Analytics endpoints (overview, analytics, platform comparison, correlation)
  - Error logging endpoint patterns with custom controller examples
  - HTTP response codes reference table
- **Code Examples** - Multiple languages:
  - JavaScript (Fetch API for React/React Native)
  - Swift (iOS native)
  - Kotlin (Android native)
  - cURL (testing)
- **Cross-References** - Links to Mobile App Integration guide
