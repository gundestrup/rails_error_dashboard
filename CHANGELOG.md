## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.26] - 2026-01-11

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Navigation Context Persistence** 🔗

Fixed issue where application_id parameter was not preserved when navigating between pages.

**Problem:**
- When selecting an application via the app switcher, the context was lost when navigating to different pages (Overview, Analytics, Settings)
- Users had to re-select the application on each page
- Poor UX for multi-app deployments

**Solution:**
- Updated sidebar navigation links to preserve `application_id` parameter across all page navigation
- Added `nav_params` helper to extract and maintain application context
- Quick filter links now merge application_id with filter parameters

**Impact:**
- Application context now persists across all dashboard pages
- Consistent multi-app experience
- No need to re-select application when navigating

**Files Changed:**
- `app/views/layouts/rails_error_dashboard.html.erb`

## [0.1.25] - 2026-01-11

### ✨ Features

**Multi-App Context Filtering** 🎯

Implemented comprehensive app-context filtering across all dashboard pages and operations.

**What's New:**

1. **Consistent Application Context**
   - When an application is selected, ALL data is now filtered to that app only
   - App context persists across all pages: Overview, Index, Analytics, Platform Comparison, Error Correlation
   - Related errors, comments, and all operations respect the selected app context

2. **Controller-Level Pattern**
   - Added `before_action :set_application_context` to establish consistent app filtering
   - Uses `@current_application_id` from URL params (`?application_id=X`)
   - "All Apps" is default when no application_id is specified

3. **Query Object Updates**
   - Updated 5 query objects to accept and respect `application_id` parameter:
     - `PlatformComparison` - Added `base_scope` method
     - `ErrorCorrelation` - Updated `base_query` to filter by application
     - `RecurringIssues` - Updated `base_query` to filter by application
     - `MttrStats` - Updated resolved_errors and trend methods
     - `FilterOptions` - Added `base_scope` method

4. **Model Method Updates**
   - Updated `ErrorLog#related_errors` to accept optional `application_id` parameter
   - Related errors now filtered by app context when specified

5. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Zero breaking changes for single-app installations
   - Works seamlessly with `use_separate_database = false`
   - All parameters optional (defaults to nil = "All Apps")

6. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Added 26 new feature specs testing multi-app context filtering
   - Tests cover all query objects and model methods
   - Verified single-app and multi-app scenarios
   - All 961 specs passing with 0 failures

**Files Changed:**
- `app/controllers/rails_error_dashboard/errors_controller.rb`
- `lib/rails_error_dashboard/queries/platform_comparison.rb`
- `lib/rails_error_dashboard/queries/error_correlation.rb`
- `lib/rails_error_dashboard/queries/recurring_issues.rb`
- `lib/rails_error_dashboard/queries/mttr_stats.rb`
- `lib/rails_error_dashboard/queries/filter_options.rb`
- `app/models/rails_error_dashboard/error_log.rb`
- `spec/features/multi_app_context_filtering_spec.rb` (new)

## [0.1.24] - 2026-01-11

### 🔒 Security Release

This release addresses mass assignment vulnerabilities identified by Brakeman security scanner.

#### Security

**1. Mass Assignment Vulnerability Fix** 🔐

Fixed 4 medium-confidence Brakeman warnings related to `params.permit!` usage:
- **Issue:** Using `params.permit!` allows any parameters to pass through, creating potential security vulnerabilities
- **Impact:** Malicious users could potentially inject unauthorized parameters
- **Fix:** Implemented explicit parameter whitelisting throughout the application

**Changes:**

1. **Added Parameter Whitelist Constant** (`app/controllers/rails_error_dashboard/errors_controller.rb`)
   ```ruby
   FILTERABLE_PARAMS = %i[
     error_type unresolved platform application_id search
     severity timeframe frequency status assigned_to
     priority_level hide_snoozed sort_by sort_direction
   ].freeze
   ```

2. **Created Secure Helper Method** (`app/helpers/rails_error_dashboard/application_helper.rb`)
   ```ruby
   def permitted_filter_params(extra_keys: [])
     base_keys = ErrorsController::FILTERABLE_PARAMS + %i[page per_page days]
     allowed_keys = base_keys + Array(extra_keys)
     params.permit(*allowed_keys).to_h.symbolize_keys
   end
   ```

3. **Replaced All `params.permit!` Calls**
   - Controller: Updated `filter_params` method to use explicit permit
   - Helper: Updated `sortable_header` to use `permitted_filter_params`
   - Views: Updated application switcher and filter pills to use secure parameters

**Files Changed:**
- `app/controllers/rails_error_dashboard/errors_controller.rb` - Whitelist constant and secure filter_params
- `app/helpers/rails_error_dashboard/application_helper.rb` - New permitted_filter_params helper
- `app/views/layouts/rails_error_dashboard.html.erb` - Secure application switcher
- `app/views/rails_error_dashboard/errors/index.html.erb` - Secure filter pills

**Security Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminates all 4 Brakeman mass assignment warnings
- ✅ Prevents unauthorized parameter injection
- ✅ Follows Rails security best practices
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility

**2. Dependency Security Update** 🔒

Updated `httparty` dependency to address CVE-2025-68696:
- **Issue:** Potential SSRF vulnerability that could lead to API key leakage
- **Before:** `httparty ~> 0.21` (v0.23.2)
- **After:** `httparty >= 0.24.0`
- **Impact:** Eliminates SSRF vulnerability in HTTP client library
- **Breaking:** None - httparty 0.24.0 is backward compatible

**Affected Components:**
- Discord notifications
- PagerDuty notifications
- Webhook notifications
- Slack notifications

---

## [0.1.23] - 2026-01-10

### ✅ Production-Ready Release

This release completes the v0.1.22 hotfix cycle with **100% CI coverage** and comprehensive integration testing across all deployment scenarios.

#### Fixed

**1. Rails 7.x Schema Compatibility (CI Database Failures)**
- **Issue:** CI failing on Rails 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 with database setup errors
- **Root Cause:** `ActiveRecord::Schema[8.0]` syntax incompatible with Rails 7.x
- **Fix:** Changed to `ActiveRecord::Schema.define` for universal compatibility
- **File:** `spec/dummy/db/schema.rb`
- **Impact:** All 15 Ruby/Rails combinations now pass CI (Rails 7.0-8.1 × Ruby 3.2-3.4)

**2. Ruby 3.2 Cache-Related Test Failures**
- **Issue:** 2 tests failing on Ruby 3.2 with transactional fixture rollbacks
- **Root Cause:** Caching ActiveRecord objects caused stale object references after test rollbacks
- **Fix:** Changed from caching objects to caching IDs with stale cache detection
- **File:** `app/models/rails_error_dashboard/application.rb`
- **Technical Details:**
  - Changed cache key from `error_dashboard/application/#{name}` to `error_dashboard/application_id/#{name}`
  - Cache now stores ID instead of object: `Rails.cache.write(..., found.id, expires_in: 1.hour)`
  - Added stale cache cleanup: detects when cached ID no longer exists in database
  - Prevents transactional rollback issues with cached object references
- **Impact:** Tests pass reliably across all Ruby versions (3.2, 3.3, 3.4)

**3. Test Isolation Issues (Configuration Pollution)**
- **Issue:** Tests passing in isolation but failing with certain random seeds (53830, 52580)
- **Root Cause:** Configuration state pollution between tests
  - `async_logging` enabled by previous tests → LogError returns Job instead of logging
  - `sampling_rate < 1.0` set by previous tests → errors skipped randomly
- **Fix:** Enhanced test setup to reset configuration state
- **Files:** `spec/features/multi_app_support_spec.rb`
- **Technical Details:**
  ```ruby
  before do
    Rails.cache.clear
    RailsErrorDashboard.configuration.sampling_rate = 1.0
    RailsErrorDashboard.configuration.async_logging = false  # Critical fix
  end
  ```
- **Impact:** Tests pass consistently regardless of random seed

#### Improvements

**1. Cache Architecture Enhancement**
- **Before:** Cached ActiveRecord objects directly (anti-pattern)
- **After:** Cache only IDs, fetch objects from database (best practice)
- **Benefits:**
  - Prevents stale object references
  - Works correctly with transactional fixtures
  - More reliable in production
  - Automatic stale cache detection and cleanup

**2. Test Configuration Management**
- Changed from stubbing to direct configuration assignment (more reliable)
- Added explicit configuration cleanup in `after` blocks
- Prevents test pollution across random seeds

#### Comprehensive Integration Testing

All installation and upgrade scenarios validated through:

**Scenario 1: Fresh Install - Single Database**
- ✅ Generator with `--no-interactive`
- ✅ 18 migrations execute successfully
- ✅ Application auto-registration works
- ✅ Error logging with `application_id` association

**Scenario 2: Fresh Install - Multi Database**
- ✅ Multi-database `database.yml` configuration
- ✅ Generator with `--separate_database --database=error_dashboard`
- ✅ Both databases created successfully
- ✅ Errors logged to separate database

**Scenario 3: Upgrade Single DB → Single DB**
- ✅ v0.1.21 → v0.1.23 upgrade path
- ✅ Existing errors preserved after upgrade
- ✅ New migrations execute successfully
- ✅ Backfill migrations populate `application_id`

**Scenario 4: Upgrade Single DB → Multi DB**
- ✅ v0.1.21 (single) → v0.1.23 (multi) migration
- ✅ Configuration change to `use_separate_database = true`
- ✅ New errors logged to error_dashboard database
- ✅ Zero code changes required

**Scenario 5: Upgrade Multi DB → Multi DB**
- ✅ v0.1.21 (multi) → v0.1.23 (multi) upgrade

## [0.1.22] - 2026-01-08

### 🚀 Major Features

#### Multi-App Support
Rails Error Dashboard now supports multiple Rails applications logging errors to a single shared database with excellent performance and zero concurrency issues.

**Database Architecture:**
- New normalized `applications` table with unique name constraint
- Added `application_id` foreign key to `error_logs` (NOT NULL with index)
- 4-phase zero-downtime migration strategy (nullable → backfill → NOT NULL → FK)
- Composite indexes for performance: `[application_id, occurred_at]`, `[application_id, resolved]`
- Expert-level concurrency design with row-level pessimistic locking

**Auto-Registration:**
- Zero-config: Applications auto-register on first error
- Automatic detection from `Rails.application.class.module_parent_name`
- Manual override via `config.application_name` or `APPLICATION_NAME` env var
- Cached lookups (1-hour TTL) prevent database hits

**UI Features:**
- Navbar app switcher dropdown (only shown with 2+ applications)
- Application filter in error list with active pill display
- Application column in error table (conditional display)
- Progressive disclosure - multi-app features only appear when needed
- Excellent UX with intuitive filtering

**Performance:**
- Per-app cache isolation prevents cross-app cache invalidation
- Row-level locking scoped by `application_id` (no cross-app contention)
- Apps write errors independently without blocking each other
- Per-app error deduplication via `error_hash` including `application_id`

**New Files:**
- `app/models/rails_error_dashboard/application.rb` - Application model
- `lib/tasks/error_dashboard.rake` - 3 rake tasks (list_applications, backfill_application, app_stats)
- 4 migrations for zero-downtime schema changes
- `docs/MULTI_APP_PERFORMANCE.md` - Performance analysis

### 🔒 Security Hardening

#### Authentication Always Required
**BREAKING CHANGE:** Authentication is now always enforced with no bypass option.

- Removed `require_authentication` config option
- Removed `require_authentication_in_development` option
- Authentication now enforced at code level (cannot be disabled)
- No development environment bypass
- Prevents accidental production exposure

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates config-based security vulnerabilities
- Consistent security across all environments
- No risk of accidentally disabling auth in production

**Migration:** Remove these lines from your initializer if present:
```ruby
config.require_authentication = false  # REMOVE
config.require_authentication_in_development = false  # REMOVE
```

### ✨ UI/UX Improvements

#### Light Theme Fixes
Fixed multiple visibility issues in light theme:
- **App Switcher Button**: Fixed invisible white text on light background
- **Dropdown Menus**: Fixed invisible menu items (white on white)
- **Chart Tooltips**: Fixed unreadable dark text on dark background
- Added proper CSS specificity with `!important` overrides
- Tested and verified in both light and dark themes

**Technical Details:**
- Added `.app-switcher-btn` CSS class with theme-aware colors
- Fixed dropdown menu colors for light/dark themes
- Dynamic Chart.js tooltip colors based on theme
- Theme-aware text colors ensure readability

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

#### Fix #1: Analytics Cache Key Bug
**File:** `lib/rails_error_dashboard/queries/analytics_stats.rb:49`

**Issue:** Cache key used `ErrorLog.maximum(:updated_at)` instead of `base_scope.maximum(:updated_at)`

**Impact:**
- Cache not properly isolated per application
- Cache invalidates globally when ANY app's errors change
- Same bug already fixed in `dashboard_stats.rb` but missed here

**Fix:** Changed to `base_scope.maximum(:updated_at)` for proper per-app cache isolation

#### Fix #2: N+1 Query in Rake Task
**File:** `lib/tasks/error_dashboard.rake`

**Issue:** `error_dashboard:list_applications` task made **6N database queries** where N = number of apps
- 10 apps = 60 queries
- 100 apps = 600 queries!

**Fix:** Single SQL query with LEFT JOIN and aggregates
```ruby
# Before: 6N queries
apps.map(&:error_count)  # N queries
apps.map(&:unresolved_error_count)  # N queries
apps.sum(&:error_count)  # 2N queries
apps.sum(&:unresolved_error_count)  # 2N queries

# After: 1 query
apps = Application
  .select('applications.*, COUNT(...) as total_errors, SUM(CASE...) as unresolved_errors')
  .joins('LEFT JOIN error_logs...')
  .group('applications.id')
```

**Performance Improvement:** ~600x faster for 100 apps (600 queries → 1 query)

### 🔧 Code Quality Improvements

#### Previous Fixes (from Initial Code Review)
- Removed orphaned test for `require_authentication`
- Fixed `dashboard_stats` cache key to use `base_scope` for proper isolation
- Simplified redundant conditional in `errors_list` filter
- Standardized logging to use `RailsErrorDashboard::Logger` throughout (5 locations)
- Updated 6 documentation files to remove authentication bypass references

#### Logger Consistency
- Changed all `Rails.logger` calls to `RailsErrorDashboard::Logger`
- Logging now respects `enable_internal_logging` configuration
- Improved error messages with class names and context

### 📚 Documentation

**New Documentation:**
- `CODE_REVIEW_REPORT.md` - Initial comprehensive review (17 issues identified)
- `FIXES_APPLIED.md` - Documentation of 6 major fixes with verification steps
- `ULTRATHINK_ANALYSIS.md` - Deep analysis (12 issues, 2 critical)
- `CRITICAL_FIXES_ULTRATHINK.md` - Documentation of 2 critical performance fixes
- `MULTI_APP_PERFORMANCE.md` - Performance benchmarks and analysis

### 📊 Performance Impact

**Before This Release:**
- Cache invalidates globally for all apps
- Rake task: 6N queries (600 for 100 apps)
- No per-app cache isolation

**After This Release:**
- Per-app cache isolation (only invalidates relevant app)
- Rake task: 1 query with aggregates (~600x improvement)
- Proper cache keys with `base_scope` filtering

### 🗄️ Database Migrations

This release includes 4 migrations for multi-app support:

1. `20260106094220_create_rails_error_dashboard_applications.rb` - Create applications table
2. `20260106094233_add_application_to_error_logs.rb` - Add application_id (nullable + indexes)
3. `20260106094256_backfill_application_for_existing_errors.rb` - Backfill existing errors
4. `20260106094318_finalize_application_foreign_key.rb` - Add NOT NULL + foreign key

**Migration Strategy:**
- Zero downtime - all changes are additive
- Backward compatible with existing data
- Automatic backfill of existing errors with default application
- Safe for production deployment

### 🧪 Testing & Verification

- All critical fixes verified with step-by-step testing
- No regressions detected
- Cache isolation verified for per-app stats
- Multi-app filtering tested with 4 applications
- Query performance tested with SQL aggregates
- All existing specs passing

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

1. **Authentication always required** - No config option to disable
   - Remove `config.require_authentication` from initializer
   - Remove `config.require_authentication_in_development` from initializer

2. **No development bypass** - Authentication enforced in all environments

### 🔄 Upgrade Instructions

## [0.1.21] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Turbo Helpers Missing in Production** - Fixed `undefined method 'turbo_stream_from'` error
  - Fixed production-only error when accessing error dashboard pages
  - Added explicit `require "turbo-rails"` to ensure helpers are available
  - Resolves initialization order issues in production mode (eager loading)
  - Error was caused by engine loading before host app's Turbo initialization
  - Affects real-time updates feature (`turbo_stream_from "error_list"`)
  - **Impact**: Dashboard now works correctly in production environments
  - **Credit**: Thanks to @bonniesimon for identifying and fixing this issue! 🎉

### Technical Details
- **File modified**: `lib/rails_error_dashboard.rb`
- **Issue**: Production eager loading caused helper unavailability
- **Solution**: Explicitly require turbo-rails alongside other dependencies
- **Related**: Similar to [turbo-rails issue #64](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails/issues/64)
- **Why development worked**: Lazy autoloading masked the problem
- **Why production failed**: Eager loading exposed initialization race condition
- 100% backward compatible - turbo-rails already a required dependency

### Community
- 🎉 **First external contribution** by @bonniesimon
- Properly identified production-only bug
- Clean, minimal fix with excellent documentation
- Followed proper issue → PR workflow

## [0.1.20] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **ManualErrorReporter - Report Errors from Frontend/Mobile Apps** - New API for logging errors without Exception objects
  - New `RailsErrorDashboard::ManualErrorReporter.report` method for manual error reporting
  - Clean keyword argument API accepts hash-like parameters (no Exception object needed)
  - Perfect for logging errors from JavaScript frontends, mobile apps (iOS/Android), or any external source
  - Supports all major platforms: Web, iOS, Android, API, or custom platforms
  - Accepts custom metadata, user IDs, app versions, backtraces, and more
  - Works with existing error grouping and deduplication system
  - Supports both sync and async logging modes
  - **Example**: `ManualErrorReporter.report(error_type: "TypeError", message: "Cannot read property 'foo'", platform: "Web", user_id: 123)`

### Improved
- **SyntheticException** - Internal bridge class for manual errors
  - Converts manual error reports into Exception-like objects
  - Seamlessly integrates with existing LogError command
  - Preserves error type, message, and backtrace information
  - Mock class returns simple error type name instead of full class path

### Enhanced
- **Platform Detection** - Respects explicitly provided platform parameter
  - ErrorContext now prioritizes manually provided platform over auto-detection
  - Allows accurate platform tracking for mobile/frontend errors
  - Falls back to user-agent detection when platform not specified
  - Added comprehensive error handling for edge cases

### Technical Details
- **New file**: `lib/rails_error_dashboard/manual_error_reporter.rb` (200+ lines)
  - `ManualErrorReporter.report` class method with keyword arguments
  - `SyntheticException` class mimics Ruby Exception interface
  - `MockClass` provides error type name for exception class
  - Normalizes backtrace input (accepts arrays or newline-separated strings)
- **Modified**: `lib/rails_error_dashboard/value_objects/error_context.rb`
  - Enhanced `detect_platform` to check for explicit platform first (line 123-140)
  - Added robust error handling with debug logging
- **Modified**: `lib/rails_error_dashboard.rb`
  - Added require for manual_error_reporter (line 5)
- **Testing**: 21 new comprehensive test cases, all 916 automated tests passing
- **Compatibility**: Works perfectly in both full Rails and API-only apps

### Use Cases
- Log JavaScript errors from React/Vue/Angular frontends

- **Configurable** - Opt-in via `config.enable_rate_limiting`
- **Graceful Responses** - Returns 429 Too Many Requests with appropriate message

#### Phase 5: Query Result Caching
- **DashboardStats Caching** - 1-minute TTL
  - Cache key includes last error update timestamp + current hour
- **AnalyticsStats Caching** - 5-minute TTL
  - Cache key includes days parameter + last error update + start date
