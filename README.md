#### 🧠 Advanced Analytics (7 Powerful Features)

**1. Baseline Anomaly Alerts** 🔔
Automatically detect unusual error rate spikes using statistical analysis (mean + std dev). Get proactive notifications when errors exceed expected baselines with intelligent cooldown to avoid alert fatigue.

**2. Fuzzy Error Matching** 🔍
Find similar errors across different error hashes using Jaccard similarity (70%) and Levenshtein distance (30%). Discover related errors that share common root causes even when they manifest differently.

**3. Co-occurring Errors** 🔗
Detect errors that happen together within configurable time windows (default: 5 minutes). Identify patterns where one error frequently triggers another, helping you prioritize fixes.

**4. Error Cascade Detection** ⛓️
Identify error chains (A causes B causes C) with probability calculations and average delays. Visualize parent→child relationships to understand cascading failures and fix root causes.

**5. Error Correlation Analysis** 📊
Correlate errors with app versions, git commits, and users. Find problematic releases, identify users affected by multiple error types, and detect time-based patterns.

**6. Platform Comparison** 📱
Compare iOS vs Android vs Web health metrics side-by-side. Platform-specific error rates, severity distributions, resolution times, and stability scores (0-100).

**7. Occurrence Pattern Detection** 📈
Detect cyclical patterns (business hours, nighttime, weekend rhythms) and error bursts (many errors in short time). Understand when and how your errors happen.

**Plus: Developer Insights Dashboard** 💡
Built-in analytics dashboard with severity detection, platform stability scoring, actionable recommendations, and recent error activity summaries (always available, no configuration needed).

#### 🔍 Source Code Integration

**View actual source code directly in error backtraces** - no need to switch to your editor or GitHub.

- **Inline Source Code Viewer** - Click "View Source" on any error frame to see the actual code with ±7 lines of context
- **Git Blame Integration** - See who last modified the code, when, and the commit message
- **Repository Links** - Jump directly to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket at the exact error line
- **Smart Caching** - Fast performance with 1-hour cache (configurable)
- **Security Controls** - Only shows your app code by default (not gems/frameworks)

```ruby
config.enable_source_code_integration = true
config.enable_git_blame = true
```

**📖 [Complete documentation →](docs/SOURCE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md)**

#### 🥖 Breadcrumbs — Request Activity Trail (NEW!)

**See exactly what happened before the crash** — SQL queries, controller actions, cache operations, job executions, and mailer deliveries captured automatically via `ActiveSupport::Notifications`.

- **Automatic capture** — Zero config beyond the enable flag (Rails already emits the events)
- **Timeline display** — Color-coded event list on each error's detail page
- **Deprecation warnings** — `deprecation.rails` events captured with caller location
- **N+1 detection** — Repeated SQL patterns flagged automatically at display time
- **Custom breadcrumbs** — `RailsErrorDashboard.add_breadcrumb("checkout started", { cart_id: 123 })`
- **Safe by design** — Fixed-size ring buffer, thread-local, every subscriber wrapped in rescue
- **Async-compatible** — Breadcrumbs harvested before background job dispatch

```ruby
config.enable_breadcrumbs = true
config.breadcrumb_buffer_size = 40  # Max events per request
```

**📖 [Complete documentation →](docs/FEATURES.md#breadcrumbs--request-activity-trail-new)**

#### 💓 System Health Snapshot (NEW!)

**Know your app's runtime state at the moment of failure** — GC stats, process memory, thread count, connection pool utilization, and Puma thread stats captured automatically when errors occur.

- **GC stats** — Heap live/free slots, major GC count, total allocated objects
- **Process memory** — RSS in MB (Linux procfs only, no subprocess/fork)
- **Thread count** — `Thread.list.count` (O(1), safe)
- **Connection pool** — Size, busy, idle, dead, waiting connections
- **Puma stats** — Running threads, max threads, pool capacity, backlog
- **Sub-millisecond** — Total snapshot < 1ms, every metric individually rescue-wrapped
- **Safe by design** — No ObjectSpace scanning, no Thread backtraces, no subprocess calls

```ruby
config.enable_system_health = true
```

**📖 [Complete documentation →](docs/FEATURES.md#system-health-snapshot-new)**

#### 🆕 v0.2 Quick Wins (NEW!)

**11 features that make error tracking smarter, safer, and more actionable:**

- **Exception Cause Chains** — Automatically captures the full `cause` chain (e.g., `SocketError` → `RuntimeError`) so you see root causes, not just wrappers
- **Enriched Context** — Every HTTP error captures `http_method`, `hostname`, `content_type`, and `request_duration_ms` automatically
- **Custom Fingerprint** — Override error grouping with a lambda: group `RecordNotFound` by controller, or any custom logic
- **CurrentAttributes Integration** — Zero-config capture of `Current.user`, `Current.account`, `Current.request_id`
- **Environment Info** — Ruby version, Rails version, gem versions, server, and database adapter captured at error time
- **Sensitive Data Filtering** — Passwords, tokens, secrets, and API keys auto-filtered from error context before storage
- **Auto-Reopen** — Resolved errors automatically reopen when they recur, with a "Reopened" badge in the UI
- **Notification Throttling** — Severity filters, per-error cooldown, and milestone threshold alerts prevent alert fatigue
- **BRIN Indexes** — PostgreSQL BRIN index on `occurred_at` for dramatically faster time-range queries (72KB vs 676MB)
- **Structured Backtrace** — Uses `backtrace_locations` for richer backtrace data with proper path/line/method fields
- **Reduced Dependencies** — Core gem now requires only `rails` + `pagy`; `browser`, `chartkick`, `httparty`, `turbo-rails` are optional

#### 🔌 Plugin System
Extensible architecture with event hooks (`on_error_logged`, `on_error_resolved`, `on_threshold_exceeded`). Built-in examples for Jira integration, metrics tracking, audit logging. Easy to create custom plugins - just drop a file in `config/initializers/error_dashboard_plugins/`.

  # ============================================================================
  # AUTHENTICATION (Always Required)
  # ============================================================================
  config.dashboard_username = ENV.fetch('ERROR_DASHBOARD_USER', 'gandalf')
  config.dashboard_password = ENV.fetch('ERROR_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD', 'youshallnotpass')

```

**📖 [Complete configuration guide →](docs/guides/CONFIGURATION.md)**

## 🏢 Multi-App Support

**Rails Error Dashboard supports logging errors from multiple Rails applications to a single shared database.**

This is ideal for:
- Managing errors across microservices
- Monitoring production, staging, and development environments separately
- Tracking different apps from a central dashboard
- Organizations running multiple Rails applications

### Automatic Configuration

By default, the dashboard automatically detects your application name from `Rails.application.class.module_parent_name`:

```ruby
# BlogApp::Application → "BlogApp"
# AdminPanel::Application → "AdminPanel"
# ApiService::Application → "ApiService"
```

**No configuration needed!** Each app will automatically register itself when logging its first error.

### Manual Override

Override the auto-detected name if desired:

```ruby
# config/initializers/rails_error_dashboard.rb
RailsErrorDashboard.configure do |config|
  config.application_name = "MyCustomAppName"
end
```

Or use an environment variable:

```bash
# .env
APPLICATION_NAME="Production API"
```

This allows you to use different names for different environments:
```bash
# Production
APPLICATION_NAME="MyApp-Production"

# Staging
APPLICATION_NAME="MyApp-Staging"

# Development
APPLICATION_NAME="MyApp-Development"
```

### Shared Database Setup

All apps must use the same error dashboard database. Configure your `database.yml`:

```yaml
# config/database.yml
production:
  primary:
    database: my_app_production
    # ... other connection settings

  error_dashboard:
    database: shared_error_dashboard_production
    host: error-db.example.com
    # ... other connection settings
```

Then in your initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/rails_error_dashboard.rb
RailsErrorDashboard.configure do |config|
  config.database = :error_dashboard  # Use the shared database
end
```

### Dashboard UI Features

**Navbar Application Switcher:**
- Quick dropdown to switch between applications
- Shows "All Apps" by default
- Only appears when multiple apps are registered

**Filter Form:**
- Filter errors by specific application
- Combine with other filters (error type, platform, etc.)
- Active filter pills show current selection

**Application Column:**
- Displays application name for each error
- Only shown when viewing "All Apps"
- Hidden when filtered to a single app

### Per-App Error Tracking

Errors are tracked independently per application:

```ruby
# Same error in different apps creates separate records
# App A: StandardError "Database timeout" → Error #1
# App B: StandardError "Database timeout" → Error #2

# Each has its own:
# - Occurrence counts
# - Resolution status
# - Comments and history
# - Analytics and trends
```

### API Usage

When logging errors via API, specify the application:

```ruby
RailsErrorDashboard::Commands::LogError.call(
  error_type: "TypeError",
  message: "Cannot read property 'name' of null",
  platform: "iOS",
  # ... other parameters
)
# Uses config.application_name automatically
```

Or override per-error (advanced):

```ruby
# Create application first
app = RailsErrorDashboard::Application.find_or_create_by!(name: "Mobile App")

# Then create error
RailsErrorDashboard::ErrorLog.create!(
  application: app,
  error_type: "NetworkError",
  message: "Request failed",
  # ... other fields
)
```

### Performance & Concurrency

Multi-app support is designed for high-concurrency scenarios:

✅ **Row-level locking** - No table locks, apps write independently
✅ **Cached lookups** - Application names cached for 1 hour
✅ **Composite indexes** - Fast filtering on `[application_id, occurred_at]`
✅ **Per-app deduplication** - Same error in different apps tracked separately
✅ **No deadlocks** - Scoped locking prevents cross-app conflicts

**Benchmark**: Tested with 5 apps writing 1000 errors/sec with zero deadlocks.

### Rake Tasks

Manage applications via rake tasks:

```bash
# List all registered applications
rails error_dashboard:list_applications

# Backfill application for existing errors
rails error_dashboard:backfill_application APP_NAME="Legacy App"
```

### Migration Guide

If you have existing errors before enabling multi-app support:

1. Run migrations: `rails db:migrate`
2. Backfill existing errors:
   ```bash
   rails error_dashboard:backfill_application APP_NAME="My App"
   ```
3. All existing errors will be assigned to "My App"
4. New applications will auto-register on first error

**Zero downtime** - Errors can continue logging during migration.

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Automatic Error Tracking

Rails Error Dashboard automatically tracks errors from:
- **Controllers** (via Rails error reporting)
- **Background jobs** (ActiveJob, Sidekiq)
- **Rack middleware** (catches everything else)

No additional code needed! Just install and it works.

### Manual Error Logging

For frontend/mobile apps or custom error logging:

```ruby
# From your Rails API
RailsErrorDashboard::Commands::LogError.call(
  error_type: "TypeError",
  message: "Cannot read property 'name' of null",
  backtrace: ["App.js:42", "index.js:12"],
  platform: "iOS",
  app_version: "2.1.0",
  user_id: current_user.id,
  context: {
    component: "ProfileScreen",
    device_model: "iPhone 14 Pro"
  }
)
```

### Frontend Integration

```javascript
// React Native example
try {
  // Your code
} catch (error) {
  fetch('https://yourapp.com/api/errors', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      error_type: error.name,
      message: error.message,
      backtrace: error.stack.split('\n'),
      platform: Platform.OS, // 'ios' or 'android'
      app_version: VERSION
    })
  });
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

1,800+ tests covering unit, integration, and browser-based system tests.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run unit/integration tests only (fast)
bundle exec rspec --exclude-pattern "spec/system/**/*"

# Run system tests only (requires Chrome)
bundle exec rspec spec/system/

# Run with visible browser for debugging
HEADLESS=false bundle exec rspec spec/system/

# Run with Chrome DevTools inspector

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this production-ready?</strong></summary>

This is currently in **beta** but actively tested with 1,800+ passing tests across Rails 7.0-8.1 and Ruby 3.2-4.0. Many users are running it in production. See [production requirements](docs/FEATURES.md#production-readiness).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does this compare to Sentry/Rollbar/Honeybadger?</strong></summary>

**Similar**: Error tracking, grouping, notifications, dashboards
**Better**: 100% free, self-hosted (your data stays with you), no usage limits, Rails-optimized
**Trade-offs**: You manage hosting/backups, fewer integrations than commercial services

See [full comparison](docs/features/PLATFORM_COMPARISON.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the performance impact?</strong></summary>

Minimal with async logging enabled:
- **Synchronous**: ~10-50ms per error (blocks request)
- **Async (recommended)**: ~1-2ms (queues to background job)
- **Sampling**: Log only 10% of non-critical errors for high-traffic apps

See [Performance Guide](docs/guides/ERROR_SAMPLING_AND_FILTERING.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use a separate database?</strong></summary>

Yes! Configure in your initializer:

```ruby
RailsErrorDashboard.configure do |config|
  config.database = :errors  # Use separate database
end
```

See [Database Options Guide](docs/guides/DATABASE_OPTIONS.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I migrate from Sentry/Rollbar?</strong></summary>

1. Install Rails Error Dashboard
2. Run both systems in parallel (1-2 weeks)
3. Verify all errors are captured
4. Remove old error tracking gem
5. Update team documentation

Historical data cannot be imported (different formats).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it work with API-only Rails apps?</strong></summary>

Yes! The error logging works in API-only mode. The dashboard UI requires a browser but can be:
- Mounted in a separate admin app
- Run in a separate Rails instance pointing to the same database
- Accessed via SSH tunnel

See [API-only setup](docs/guides/MOBILE_APP_INTEGRATION.md#backend-setup-rails-api).
</details>

<summary><strong>How do I track multiple Rails apps?</strong></summary>

Automatic! Just set `APP_NAME` environment variable:

```bash
# App 1
APP_NAME=my-api rails server

# App 2
APP_NAME=my-admin rails server
```

All apps share the same dashboard. See [Multi-App Guide](docs/MULTI_APP_PERFORMANCE.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I customize error severity levels?</strong></summary>

Yes! Configure custom rules in your initializer:

```ruby
RailsErrorDashboard.configure do |config|
  config.custom_severity_rules = {
    /ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound/ => :low,
    /Stripe::/ => :critical
  }
end
```

See [Customization Guide](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How long are errors stored?</strong></summary>

Forever by default (no automatic deletion). Manual cleanup with rake task:

```bash
# Delete resolved errors older than 90 days
rails error_dashboard:cleanup_resolved DAYS=90

# Filter by application name
rails error_dashboard:cleanup_resolved DAYS=30 APP_NAME="My App"
```

Or schedule with cron/whenever. See [Database Optimization](docs/guides/DATABASE_OPTIMIZATION.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I get Slack/Discord notifications?</strong></summary>

Yes! Enable during installation or configure manually:

```ruby
RailsErrorDashboard.configure do |config|
  config.enable_slack_notifications = true
  config.slack_webhook_url = ENV['SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL']
end
```

Supports Slack, Discord, Email, PagerDuty, and custom webhooks. See [Notifications Guide](docs/guides/NOTIFICATIONS.md).

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it work with Turbo/Hotwire?</strong></summary>

Yes! Includes Turbo Streams support for real-time updates. Errors appear in the dashboard instantly without page refresh.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I report errors from mobile apps (React Native/Flutter)?</strong></summary>

Make HTTP POST requests to your Rails API:

```javascript
// React Native example
fetch('https://api.example.com/error_dashboard/api/v1/errors', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Basic ' + btoa('admin:password')
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    error_class: 'TypeError',
    message: 'Cannot read property...',
    platform: 'iOS'
  })
});
```

See [Mobile App Integration](docs/guides/MOBILE_APP_INTEGRATION.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I build custom integrations?</strong></summary>

Yes! Use the plugin system:

```ruby
class MyCustomPlugin < RailsErrorDashboard::Plugin
  def on_error_logged(error_log)
    # Your custom logic
  end
end

RailsErrorDashboard::PluginRegistry.register(MyCustomPlugin.new)
```

See [Plugin System Guide](docs/PLUGIN_SYSTEM.md).
