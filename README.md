## From the Community

> All three [self-hosted alternatives] had an issue with error backtrace when using Turbo — RED did fix it… solid_errors and Faultline are not very active projects, RED is very active and @AnjanJ is very responsive in fixing issues. So, RED was my final choice.

## Who This Is For

- **Solo bootstrappers** who need professional error tracking without recurring costs
- **Indie SaaS founders** building profitable apps on tight budgets
- **Small dev teams** (2-5 people) who hate SaaS bloat
- **Privacy-conscious apps** that need to keep error data on their own servers
- **Side projects** that might become real businesses

## What It Replaces

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| $29-99/month for error monitoring | $0/month — runs on your existing Rails server |
| Sensitive error data sent to third parties | All data stays on your infrastructure |
| SaaS pricing tiers and usage limits | Unlimited errors, unlimited projects |
| Vendor lock-in with proprietary APIs | 100% open source, fully portable |
| Complex SDK setup and external services | 5-minute Rails Engine installation |
| Pay extra for local variable capture (Sentry) | Local + instance variables included free |
| No tool detects silently rescued exceptions | Swallowed exception detection built in |

---

## Features

### Core (Always Enabled)

Error capture from controllers, jobs, and middleware. Custom-designed dashboard with dark/light mode, search, filtering, and real-time updates. Analytics with trend charts, severity breakdown, and spike detection. Workflow management with assignment, priority, snooze, mute/unmute (notification suppression), comments, and batch operations. Security via HTTP Basic Auth or custom lambda (Devise, Warden, session-based). Exception cause chains, enriched HTTP context, custom fingerprinting, CurrentAttributes integration, auto-reopen on recurrence, and sensitive data filtering — all built in.

### Optional Features

<details>
<summary><strong>Storm Protection — Circuit Breaker + Adaptive Sampling</strong></summary>

When the error rate spikes (a bad deploy throwing thousands of errors a minute), the nightmare scenario for any in-process tracker is amplifying the outage with its own database writes. Storm protection makes the gem **provably degrade itself first** — ON by default.

- **Per-fingerprint caps:** past N occurrences/minute per error, context is shed, then rows are sampled deterministically (a fresh exemplar is always kept each minute)
- **Global circuit breaker:** sustained floods flip the gem to count-only mode — zero per-event I/O, exact in-memory counts reconciled onto error records every 30s. Async mode is gated too (a SolidQueue enqueue is itself a DB write)
- **One storm notification** replaces hundreds of per-error pings; auto-issue creation is capped (default 5 per 10 min) so a storm of new errors can't open 500 GitHub/Linear issues
- **Honest accounting:** a dashboard banner during/after the storm, a Storm History page with exact counts of everything shed, and `reached_open`/peak-rate per episode. Counts are never extrapolated
- **Calm-weather economy:** after 25 full-context captures of the same error per day, context is sampled (occurrence counting unaffected)
- **Fails open:** any internal storm-protection error means full capture. Protection can never be the thing that loses an error

```ruby
config.enable_storm_protection = true  # default
config.storm_open_threshold_per_second = 50  # per process
```

All thresholds are per process and individually configurable. Disable with one flag.

**Measured overhead** (Apple Silicon, Ruby 4.0): 2.4µs/error with protection active and calm, 2.95µs in count-only mode, 0.2µs when disabled — against a 5µs budget. The check is a digest plus an atomic increment; there is no I/O on the hot path.

<details>
<summary><strong>Breadcrumbs — Request Activity Trail</strong></summary>

See exactly what happened before the crash — SQL queries, controller actions, cache operations, job executions, and mailer deliveries captured automatically via `ActiveSupport::Notifications`.

- Automatic capture — zero config beyond the enable flag
- N+1 query detection with aggregate patterns page
- Deprecation warnings with aggregate view
- Custom breadcrumbs via `RailsErrorDashboard.add_breadcrumb("checkout started", { cart_id: 123 })`
- Safe by design — fixed-size ring buffer, thread-local, every subscriber wrapped in rescue

```ruby
config.enable_breadcrumbs = true
```

[Complete documentation →](docs/FEATURES.md#breadcrumbs--request-activity-trail-new)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>System Health Snapshot</strong></summary>

Know your app's runtime state at the moment of failure — GC stats, process memory, thread count, connection pool utilization, Puma thread stats, RubyVM cache health, YJIT compilation stats, and deep runtime insights captured automatically.

- Sub-millisecond total snapshot, every metric individually rescue-wrapped
- No ObjectSpace scanning, no Thread backtraces, no subprocess calls
- RubyVM.stat: constant cache invalidations, shape cache stats
- YJIT runtime stats: compiled iseqs, invalidation count, code region sizes
- **v0.5.2** — File descriptor utilization, system load averages, system memory pressure, TCP connection states, GC context (trigger reason, last major/minor), process swap and peak RSS — all with color-coded danger indicators

```ruby
config.enable_system_health = true
```

[Complete documentation →](docs/FEATURES.md#system-health-snapshot-new)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>N+1 Detection + Deprecation Warnings</strong></summary>

Cross-error N+1 detection grouped by SQL fingerprint, and aggregate deprecation warnings with occurrence counts.

![Deprecation Warnings](docs/images/deprecations.png)

![N+1 Query Patterns](docs/images/n-plus-one-queries.png)

Requires breadcrumbs to be enabled.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Operational Health Panels — Jobs, Database, Cache, ActionCable</strong></summary>

**Job Health** — Auto-detects Sidekiq, SolidQueue, or GoodJob. Per-error table with adapter badge, failed count (color-coded), sorted worst-first.

![Job Health](docs/images/job-health.png)

**Database Health** — PgHero-style live PostgreSQL stats (table sizes, unused indexes, dead tuples, vacuum timestamps) plus historical connection pool data from error snapshots. PostgreSQL-only for the system-table views; MySQL and SQLite show connection pool stats and hide the rest.

![Database Health](docs/images/database-health.png)

**Cache Health** — Per-error cache performance sorted worst-first.

![Cache Health](docs/images/cache-health.png)

**ActionCable Health** — Track WebSocket channel actions, transmissions, subscription confirmations, and rejections. Dashboard page at `/errors/actioncable_health_summary` with channel breakdown sorted by rejections. System health snapshot captures live connection count and adapter.

```ruby
config.enable_actioncable_tracking = true  # requires enable_breadcrumbs = true
```

**ActiveStorage Health** — Track file uploads, downloads, deletes, and existence checks across storage services (Disk, S3, GCS, Azure — any ActiveStorage backend). Dashboard page at `/errors/activestorage_health_summary` with per-service operation counts, average and slowest durations. Helps identify slow storage operations correlating with errors.

```ruby
config.enable_activestorage_tracking = true  # requires enable_breadcrumbs = true
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>LLM Observability — Calls, Tokens, Cost, Tool Use</strong></summary>

Capture every LLM call your app makes — model, latency, token counts, estimated USD cost, and tool-use requests — as breadcrumbs on the error that follows. When a request crashes, you see the chat completion that preceded it: which model was called, how long it took, what it cost, and which tools it asked to invoke.

- Three capture paths — pick whichever matches your stack
- Cost estimated from a built-in pricing table (Claude 4.x, GPT-4o/o1, Gemini 2.5) — override per-model via `config.llm_pricing_overrides`
- Tool-call requests summarized inline; tool *execution* spans captured separately via the OTel path
- Content capture (prompts/completions) **OFF by default** — only token counts and metadata are recorded
- Same host-app safety guarantees as the rest of the gem — never raises, never blocks the request, every callback rescue-wrapped

```ruby
config.enable_breadcrumbs        = true   # required — LLM crumbs ride the breadcrumb pipeline
config.enable_llm_observability  = true
# Optional — override the built-in pricing table for your account
# config.llm_pricing_overrides = { "claude-sonnet-4-6" => { input: 3.0, output: 15.0 } }
```

**Path A — `ruby-openai` (Faraday middleware)**

```ruby
# Gemfile already has: gem "ruby-openai"
client = OpenAI::Client.new do |f|
  f.use RailsErrorDashboard::Integrations::LlmMiddleware
end
```

**Path B — `ruby_llm` (OpenTelemetry)**

`ruby_llm` doesn't expose a Faraday hook, but the thoughtbot OTel instrumentation gem emits GenAI-semconv spans that our SpanProcessor picks up automatically.

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "ruby_llm"
gem "opentelemetry-sdk"
gem "opentelemetry-instrumentation-ruby_llm"

# config/initializers/opentelemetry.rb
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use "OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::RubyLLM"
end
```

The dashboard's `LlmSpanProcessor` registers itself with `OpenTelemetry.tracer_provider` during engine boot — no extra wiring.

**Path C — anything else (Anthropic official SDK, Net::HTTP, gRPC, Ollama, …)**

The official `anthropic` gem uses `Net::HTTP` directly (no Faraday hook), and many local-inference setups don't run OTel. Wrap any LLM call in `ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument` — pass a mutable Hash so token counts can be filled in *after* the call:

```ruby
payload = { provider: "anthropic", model: "claude-sonnet-4-6" }

ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument("red.llm_call", payload) do
  response = Anthropic::Client.new.messages.create(
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    messages: [ { role: "user", content: "hi" } ]
  )
  payload[:input_tokens]  = response.usage.input_tokens
  payload[:output_tokens] = response.usage.output_tokens
end

# Tool execution — captured as its own llm_tool breadcrumb
ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument("red.llm_tool_call",
  tool_name: "search_database",
  tool_arguments: { query: "..." }
) do
  # run the tool
end
```

Payload contract matches the `LlmCallEvent` value object — see [`docs/LLM_OBSERVABILITY.md`](docs/LLM_OBSERVABILITY.md) for the full field list.

<details>
<summary><strong>Issue Tracking — GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, Linear</strong></summary>

One switch connects errors to your issue tracker. Platform becomes the source of truth — status, assignees, labels, and comments are mirrored live in the dashboard.

- **Create & link:** "Create Issue" button or paste an existing URL
- **Auto-create:** New errors auto-create issues. Critical/high severity always creates
- **Lifecycle sync:** Resolve → close, recur → reopen + comment, all via background jobs
- **Platform mirror:** Issue state, assignees (with avatars), labels (with colors), and comments displayed in the dashboard. Workflow controls (Resolve, Assign, Priority) replaced by platform state
- **Two-way webhooks:** Issue closed/reopened on platform syncs back to dashboard
- **RED branding:** Issues show "Created by RED (Rails Error Dashboard)"

```ruby
config.enable_issue_tracking = true
config.issue_tracker_token = ENV["RED_BOT_TOKEN"]
# That's it — provider and repo auto-detected from git_repository_url
```

Linear works too — it's not a git forge, so set the provider and team key explicitly:

```ruby
config.enable_issue_tracking = true
config.issue_tracker_provider = :linear
config.issue_tracker_repo = "ENG"  # Linear team key (issues land as ENG-123)
config.issue_tracker_token = ENV["RED_BOT_TOKEN"]  # lin_api_... personal API key
```

Closing maps to the team's first `completed` workflow state, reopening to `unstarted`/`backlog`. Two-way sync uses Linear webhooks (`Linear-Signature` HMAC verification).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>User Impact Scoring</strong></summary>

Dedicated `/errors/user_impact` page ranking errors by unique users affected — not occurrence count. An error hitting 1000 users once ranks higher than hitting 1 user 1000 times. Shows impact percentage (when `total_users_for_impact` is configured or auto-detected), severity badges, and per-error drill-down links.

No configuration needed — works automatically when errors have `user_id` (auto-detected via `CurrentAttributes` or `current_user`).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Scheduled Digests</strong></summary>

Daily or weekly error summary emails — new errors, resolution rate, top errors by count, critical unresolved, and period-over-period comparison. HTML + text templates. Users schedule the job via SolidQueue, Sidekiq, or cron.

```ruby
config.enable_scheduled_digests = true
config.digest_frequency = :daily  # or :weekly
# config.digest_recipients = ["team@example.com"]  # defaults to notification_email_recipients
```

Schedule: `rails error_dashboard:send_digest PERIOD=daily`
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Release Tracking</strong></summary>

Dedicated Releases page at `/errors/releases` shows a timeline of all deploys/versions with health stats. Answers: "Did this deploy introduce new errors?" and "Is this release stable?"

- **Release timeline:** Every version seen, sorted newest-first, with error counts, unique types, and time range
- **"New in this release":** Errors whose fingerprint first appeared in each version — flagged with a red badge
- **Stability indicators:** Green (at or below average), yellow (1-2x), red (>2x average error rate)
- **Release comparison:** Delta and percentage change vs the previous release
- **Current release:** Highlighted card with live health stats
- **Zero config:** Works automatically when `app_version` or `git_sha` is set (via config, `APP_VERSION`, `GIT_SHA`, `HEROKU_SLUG_COMMIT`, or `RENDER_GIT_COMMIT` env vars)

```ruby
config.app_version = "1.2.0"           # or set APP_VERSION env var
config.git_sha = ENV["GIT_SHA"]        # auto-detected on Heroku/Render
config.git_repository_url = "https://github.com/user/repo"  # enables SHA links
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Source Code Integration + Git Blame</strong></summary>

View actual source code directly in error backtraces with +/-7 lines of context. Git blame shows who last modified the code, when, and the commit message. Repository links jump to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket at the exact line.

```ruby
config.enable_source_code_integration = true
config.enable_git_blame = true
```

[Complete documentation →](docs/SOURCE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Code Path Coverage (Diagnostic Mode)</strong></summary>

Enable coverage via a dashboard button to see which production code paths were executed. Source code viewer overlays green checkmarks on executed lines and gray dots on unexecuted lines. Uses Ruby's `Coverage.setup(oneshot_lines: true)` — near-zero overhead, each line fires once. Zero overhead when off.

```ruby
config.enable_coverage_tracking = true   # shows Enable/Disable buttons on error detail page
config.enable_source_code_integration = true  # required for source code viewer
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>AI Help + Error Replay — Ask, Copy as cURL / RSpec / LLM Markdown</strong></summary>

Replay failing requests with one click. Copy the request as a cURL command, generate an RSpec test, or **copy all error details as clean Markdown** for pasting into an LLM session. The LLM export includes app backtrace, cause chain, local/instance variables, breadcrumbs, environment, system health, and related errors — with framework frames filtered and sensitive data preserved as `[FILTERED]`.

When an LLM provider is configured, the error detail page also shows an **AI Help** drawer. Users can ask follow-up questions about the current error and receive streamed Markdown answers from OpenAI or Anthropic without leaving the dashboard.

```ruby
config.llm_provider = :openai # or :anthropic
config.llm_api_key = -> { Rails.application.credentials.dig(:openai, :api_key) }
config.llm_model = "gpt-5"
```

> **Privacy:** AI Help sends the error's details (backtrace, context, and your question) to the configured provider (OpenAI or Anthropic). Keep `config.filter_sensitive_data = true` (the default) so sensitive values are redacted as `[FILTERED]` before they leave your app.

[Complete documentation →](docs/FEATURES.md#error-details-page)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Notifications — Slack, Discord, PagerDuty, Email, Webhooks</strong></summary>

Multi-channel alerting with severity filters, per-error cooldown, and milestone threshold alerts to prevent alert fatigue.

```ruby
config.enable_slack_notifications = true
config.slack_webhook_url = ENV['SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL']
```

[Notification setup guide →](docs/guides/NOTIFICATIONS.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Advanced Analytics</strong></summary>

![Analytics](docs/images/analytics.png)

Seven analysis engines built in:

1. **Baseline Anomaly Alerts** — Statistical spike detection (mean + std dev) with intelligent cooldown
2. **Fuzzy Error Matching** — Jaccard similarity + Levenshtein distance to find related errors
3. **Co-occurring Errors** — Detect errors that happen together within configurable time windows
4. **Error Cascade Detection** — Identify chains (A causes B causes C) with probability and delays
5. **Error Correlation Analysis** — Correlate errors with app versions, git commits, and users
6. **Platform Comparison** — iOS vs Android vs Web health metrics side-by-side
7. **Occurrence Pattern Detection** — Cyclical patterns (business hours, weekends) and burst detection

[Complete documentation →](docs/FEATURES.md#advanced-analytics-features)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Local Variable + Instance Variable Capture</strong></summary>

See the exact values of local variables and instance variables at the moment an exception was raised — the most valuable debugging context possible.

- TracePoint(`:raise`) captures locals and ivars before the stack unwinds
- Configurable limits: max variable count, nesting depth, string truncation length
- Sensitive data auto-filtered via Rails `filter_parameters` — passwords, tokens, and PII never stored
- Never stores Binding objects — values extracted immediately, Binding is GC'd
- Independent config flags: enable one or both

![Local Variables](docs/images/local-variables.png)

```ruby
config.enable_local_variables = true
config.enable_instance_variables = true
```

[Complete documentation →](docs/FEATURES.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Swallowed Exception Detection</strong></summary>

Detect exceptions that are raised but silently rescued — the hardest bugs to find. No other error tracker does this.

- Uses TracePoint(`:raise`) + TracePoint(`:rescue`) to track exception lifecycle
- Identifies code paths where exceptions are caught but never logged or re-raised
- Dashboard page at `/errors/swallowed_exceptions` shows detection counts, locations, and patterns
- Memory-bounded aggregation with background flush
- Requires Ruby 3.3+

![Swallowed Exceptions](docs/images/swallowed-exceptions.png)

```ruby
config.detect_swallowed_exceptions = true
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>On-Demand Diagnostic Dump</strong></summary>

Snapshot your app's entire system state on demand — environment, GC stats, threads, connection pool, memory, job queue health, and more.

- Trigger via dashboard button or `rake rails_error_dashboard:diagnostic_dump`
- Dashboard page at `/errors/diagnostic_dumps` with full history
- Useful for debugging intermittent production issues without reproducing them

![Diagnostic Dumps](docs/images/diagnostic-dumps.png)

```ruby
config.enable_diagnostic_dump = true
```

[Complete documentation →](docs/FEATURES.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Rack Attack Event Tracking</strong></summary>

Track Rack Attack security events (throttles, blocklists, tracks) as breadcrumbs attached to errors, with a dedicated summary page.

- Captures throttle, blocklist, and track events automatically
- Dashboard page at `/errors/rack_attack_summary` with event breakdown
- Requires breadcrumbs to be enabled

```ruby
config.enable_rack_attack_tracking = true
```

[Complete documentation →](docs/FEATURES.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Process Crash Capture</strong></summary>

Capture unhandled exceptions that crash the Ruby process via an `at_exit` hook — the last line of defense.

- Disk-based fallback: writes crash data to disk because the database may be unavailable during shutdown
- Imported automatically on next boot
- Captures exception details, backtrace, uptime, GC stats, thread count, and cause chain
- A self-hosted only feature — impossible for SaaS tools

```ruby
config.enable_crash_capture = true
```

[Complete documentation →](docs/FEATURES.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Plugin System</strong></summary>

Event-driven extensibility with hooks for `on_error_logged`, `on_error_resolved`, `on_threshold_exceeded`. Built-in examples for Jira integration, metrics tracking, and audit logging.

```ruby
class MyPlugin < RailsErrorDashboard::Plugin
  def on_error_logged(error_log)
    # Your custom logic
  end
end
```

[Plugin System guide →](docs/PLUGIN_SYSTEM.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>OpenTelemetry Export — Emit Gem Operations as Spans</strong></summary>

Send the gem's error-capture pipeline as OpenTelemetry spans to your existing Datadog, Honeycomb, or Jaeger collector. Each stage of the capture path — DB write, breadcrumb harvest, system health snapshot, and notification dispatch — becomes a named child span so you can audit gem overhead from your own observability dashboards.

- Off by default — zero impact unless you opt in
- No-op when the OTel API gem isn't loaded
- Per-span-kind opt-in: enable only the stages you care about
- Every span individually rescue-wrapped — never raises into host code
- Boot-time warning if `enable_otel_export = true` but `opentelemetry-api` isn't in the Gemfile

```ruby
# Gemfile — only the API gem is required; the SDK is optional
gem "opentelemetry-api"

# config/initializers/rails_error_dashboard.rb
config.enable_otel_export  = true
config.otel_service_name   = "my-app"   # falls back to application_name
config.otel_spans          = [:capture, :breadcrumbs, :health, :notifications]  # all (default)
# config.otel_spans        = [:capture]                                          # parent span only
```

Span names follow the `rails_error_dashboard.<operation>` convention, e.g. `rails_error_dashboard.capture_error`. Both attributes are attached to every span: `rails_error_dashboard.version` and `rails_error_dashboard.service_name` — use them to filter the gem's traffic in your dashboards.

## FAQ

**Does Rails Error Dashboard support a separate database for errors?**
Yes. You can store errors in your app's existing database (shared) **or** in a dedicated, isolated database (separate). Set `config.use_separate_database = true` (or `USE_SEPARATE_ERROR_DB=true`) and point it at a separate connection — the engine routes all of its tables through `connects_to`, keeping error data fully isolated from your app data. Both modes are first-class and covered by the [Database Options guide](docs/guides/DATABASE_OPTIONS.md).

**Which databases does it work with?**
SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL/Trilogy — in either shared or separate-database mode.

**Is this a self-hosted alternative to Sentry?**
Yes. It runs entirely inside your own Rails process — no external services, no SDK calling out, no per-event pricing. Error data never leaves your infrastructure.

**Does it capture local variables like Sentry?**
Yes — local **and** instance variables at the moment the exception is raised, via `TracePoint(:raise)`, with sensitive-data filtering and configurable limits. This is opt-in and a capability Sentry charges extra for.

**Will a flood of errors take down my app?**
No. Storm protection (a circuit breaker with adaptive sampling, **ON by default**) makes the gem degrade itself first during error floods — occurrence counts stay exact while it sheds the expensive work. Measured hot-path overhead is ~2.4µs/error.

**Does it work with my background jobs?**
Yes — it auto-detects and supports Sidekiq, SolidQueue, and GoodJob, and can log errors asynchronously through any of them.

**Does it work with my authentication?**
Yes — HTTP Basic Auth out of the box, or a custom `authenticate_with` lambda that integrates with Devise, Warden, or session-based auth.

**Can it track more than one app?**
Yes — multi-app support tracks errors from multiple Rails apps in one dashboard with per-app filtering.

**What Rails and Ruby versions are supported?**
Rails 7.0–8.1 and Ruby 3.2–4.0.

## Architecture

Built with **CQRS (Command/Query Responsibility Segregation)**:
- **Commands** — LogError, ResolveError, BatchOperations (writes)
- **Queries** — ErrorsList, DashboardStats, Analytics (reads)
- **Services** — PlatformDetector, SimilarityCalculator (business logic)
- **Plugins** — Event-driven extensibility
