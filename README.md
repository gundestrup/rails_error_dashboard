**Rails-native error tracking for failure investigation — see the Ruby state and Rails runtime health behind every exception. Self-hosted, inside your app, in your own database. The gem is MIT and free forever.**

```ruby
gem "rails_error_dashboard"
```

```bash
bundle install
rails generate rails_error_dashboard:install
rails db:migrate
```

Open `/red`, then send a test error from its Settings page. No monitoring account or ingestion service is required.

> **Beta:** RED is functional and extensively tested, but configuration and APIs may change before 1.0. Supports Rails 7.0–8.1 and Ruby 3.2–4.0 (CI runs Ruby 3.2–3.4 against every supported Rails version; Ruby 4.0 is verified by the maintainer).

## See the Ruby state and Rails runtime health behind every exception

Rails Error Dashboard (RED) is an open-source, self-hosted Rails engine for investigating production failures. It helps you answer not only **what failed**, but **what was happening inside Ruby and Rails when it failed**.

- Inspect local variables and the raising object's instance variables before the stack unwinds.
- See error-time Active Record, Puma, job queue, GC, memory and process health.
- Follow the SQL, cache, controller, job, mailer and other Rails events leading to the exception.
- Stay safe during error floods with progressive, count-preserving storm protection.
- Keep exception data on infrastructure you control.

![Local and instance variables captured at the raise, scrubbed with filter_parameters](docs/images/local-variables.png)

## The questions RED helps you answer

A stack trace tells you where execution stopped. RED helps you investigate the state behind it:

- What did `params`, local variables and objects such as `@order` contain?
- Was the Active Record pool exhausted?
- Was Puma out of thread capacity or building a backlog?
- Were jobs failing or queues growing?
- Was the process under GC, memory, descriptor or system pressure?
- Which SQL queries, cache operations or Rails events preceded the failure?
- Did a deploy introduce the error?
- Can the failing request become a cURL reproduction or RSpec regression-test scaffold?

## What makes RED different

### Failure-time Ruby state

Optionally capture local variables and — something no other error tracker does — the raising receiver's instance variables at `TracePoint(:raise)`, with bounded serialization and your Rails `filter_parameters` applied to sensitive values. Binding objects are never retained.

### Failure-time Rails health

Attach connection-pool, Puma, background-job, GC, memory, file-descriptor, TCP, RubyVM and YJIT state to the error record, refreshed on every captured occurrence — not merely to a separate periodic metrics chart. Every APM has these as time-series; none attaches them to the error. Opt-in; the procfs-backed fields are Linux-only.

### Monitoring that degrades safely

During an error flood, RED progressively reduces captured context and database work, keeps a fresh exemplar every minute, records the storm in a Storm History ledger and reconciles exact in-process occurrence counts onto the error records. On by default.

### Rails-specific investigation

Connect exceptions with SQL, caching, Active Job, Action Cable, Active Storage, Rack::Attack, deprecations and other Rails subsystems from one dashboard.

### Things no other tracker does

Verified against Sentry, Honeybadger, AppSignal, Rollbar, Bugsnag, Airbrake, Raygun, New Relic, Datadog, Scout, Skylight and every self-hosted Rails tracker in August 2026 ([the ledger](.shipkit/research/red-unique-features-verified.md)):

- **Copy as RSpec** — a runnable request spec generated from the captured request (Sentry offers curl only).
- **Swallowed-exception aggregate** — raise-vs-rescue ratio per location, no APM span needed (Datadog's paid APM detects rescued exceptions but keeps no aggregate).
- **Rack::Attack ledger** — throttle, blocklist and track events persisted with per-rule stats and an AI-crawler classifier; rack-attack ships no UI of its own.
- **Codeberg issue tracking**, alongside GitHub, GitLab and Linear with two-way sync.
- **The tracker instruments itself** — its capture pipeline exported as OpenTelemetry spans, so you can audit its overhead in your own APM.

## How RED compares

| Basic embedded tracker | General SaaS monitoring | RED |
|---|---|---|
| Stack trace and context | Cross-language telemetry and managed ingestion | Deep failure-time Ruby/Rails state inside the application boundary |
| Lightweight and local | Strong distributed and frontend observability | Rails-specific operational investigation and storm-safe local capture |

That makes RED a self-hosted Sentry alternative for teams that want Rails-specific depth and need error data to stay inside the application boundary — not a replacement for cross-language telemetry. RED has no mobile SDKs, no merge/split, no MCP server and no hosted operations.

## Choose how you run it

- Store data in the application's existing PostgreSQL, MySQL/Trilogy or SQLite database.
- Isolate monitoring writes in a separate error database.
- Use synchronous writes, or async logging through your app's own Active Job backend (Sidekiq, Solid Queue, GoodJob or Rails' in-process `:async`).
- Track several Rails applications through a shared database.

No RED licence or event-ingestion fee, and no plan limits — your database is the only cap, and storm protection deliberately sheds context during floods.

## From the Community

> All three [self-hosted alternatives] had an issue with error backtrace when using Turbo — RED did fix it… solid_errors and Faultline are not very active projects, RED is very active and @AnjanJ is very responsive in fixing issues. So, RED was my final choice.

## Safety, performance and compatibility

- **Host-app safety** — nothing in the capture path raises into your app; every subscriber and callback is rescue-wrapped, `Thread.current` is cleaned up in `ensure`, and the original exception is always re-raised. Variables, health and breadcrumbs are opt-in and off by default; storm protection is on by default and fails open.
- **Performance** — the storm-protection hot path is a digest plus an atomic increment with no I/O; the figures quoted below are a maintainer's single-machine measurements and no benchmark script ships with the gem yet.
- **Security** — HTTP Basic Auth or your own `authenticate_with` lambda (Devise, Warden, session); your Rails `filter_parameters` are applied to params, variables and breadcrumbs; prompts are never recorded by LLM observability. Vulnerability reports: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Compatibility** — Rails 7.0–8.1, Ruby 3.2–4.0, PostgreSQL, MySQL/Trilogy or SQLite; `turbo-rails` plus ActionCable are needed for live updates (no polling fallback); the gem's own CSS/JS is inline but Bootstrap JS, Chart.js, highlight.js and Google Fonts load from CDNs, so it is not air-gap clean.

## Features

### Core (Always Enabled)

Error capture from controllers, jobs, and middleware. Custom-designed dashboard with dark/light mode, search, filtering, and real-time updates (the latter with `turbo-rails` + ActionCable in the host). Analytics with trend charts, severity breakdown, and spike detection. Workflow management with assignment, priority, snooze, mute/unmute (notification suppression), comments, and batch operations. Security via HTTP Basic Auth or custom lambda (Devise, Warden, session-based). Exception cause chains, enriched HTTP context, custom fingerprinting, CurrentAttributes integration, auto-reopen on recurrence, and sensitive data filtering — all built in.

### Optional Features

<details>
<summary><strong>Storm Protection — Circuit Breaker + Adaptive Sampling</strong></summary>

When the error rate spikes (a bad deploy throwing thousands of errors a minute), the nightmare scenario for any in-process tracker is amplifying the outage with its own database writes. Storm protection is designed to **shed the gem's own expensive work first** — ON by default. The behaviour is measured (see Overhead below), though a bundled, reproducible benchmark is still to come.

- **Per-fingerprint caps:** past N occurrences/minute per error, context is shed, then rows are sampled deterministically (a fresh exemplar is always kept each minute)
- **Global circuit breaker:** sustained floods flip the gem to count-only mode — zero per-event I/O, exact in-memory counts reconciled onto error records every 30s. Async mode is gated too (a SolidQueue enqueue is itself a DB write)
- **One storm notification** replaces hundreds of per-error pings; auto-issue creation is capped (default 5 per 10 min) so a storm of new errors can't open 500 GitHub/Linear issues
- **Honest accounting:** a dashboard banner during/after the storm, a Storm History page with exact counts of everything shed, and `reached_open`/peak-rate per episode. Counts are never extrapolated
- **Calm-weather economy:** after 25 full-context captures of the same error per day, context is sampled (occurrence counting unaffected)
- **Fails open:** any internal storm-protection error means full capture. Protection can never be the thing that loses an error

```ruby
config.enable_storm_protection = true  # default
config.storm_open_threshold_per_second = 50  # per process
```

All thresholds are per process and individually configurable. Disable with one flag.

**Overhead:** the check is a digest plus an atomic increment; there is no I/O on the hot path. The maintainer's single-machine measurement (Apple Silicon, Ruby 4.0) was 2.4µs/error with protection active and calm, 2.95µs in count-only mode and 0.2µs when disabled, against a 5µs budget — a reproducible benchmark script is not yet part of the gem.

<details>
<summary><strong>Breadcrumbs — Request Activity Trail</strong></summary>

See exactly what happened before the crash — SQL queries, controller actions, cache operations, job executions, and mailer deliveries captured automatically via `ActiveSupport::Notifications`.

- Automatic capture — zero config beyond the enable flag
- N+1 query detection with aggregate patterns page
- Deprecation warnings with aggregate view (needs the host's deprecation behaviour to include `:notify`; only requests that later raised are seen)
- Custom breadcrumbs via `RailsErrorDashboard.add_breadcrumb("checkout started", { cart_id: 123 })`
- Safe by design — fixed-size ring buffer, thread-local, every subscriber wrapped in rescue

```ruby
config.enable_breadcrumbs = true
```

[Complete documentation →](docs/FEATURES.md#breadcrumbs--request-activity-trail-new)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>System Health Snapshot</strong></summary>

Know your app's runtime state at the moment of failure — GC stats, process memory, thread count, connection pool utilization, Puma thread stats, RubyVM cache health, YJIT compilation stats, and deep runtime insights captured automatically.

- Sub-millisecond for the in-process metrics, every metric individually rescue-wrapped. The one exception is job-queue depth (five `COUNT`s for Solid Queue, a Redis round-trip for Sidekiq): those are queries against your queue store, cached for 10 s per process and switchable off with `config.system_health_queue_stats = false`
- No ObjectSpace scanning, no Thread backtraces, no subprocess calls
- RubyVM.stat: constant cache invalidations, shape cache stats
- YJIT runtime stats: compiled iseqs, invalidation count, code region sizes
- **v0.5.2** — File descriptor utilization, system load averages, system memory pressure, TCP connection states, GC context (trigger reason, last major/minor), process swap and peak RSS — all with color-coded danger indicators

```ruby
config.enable_system_health = true
```

[Complete documentation →](docs/FEATURES.md#system-health-snapshot-new)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>N+1 Detection + Deprecation Warnings</strong></summary>

Cross-error N+1 detection grouped by SQL fingerprint, and aggregate deprecation warnings with occurrence counts.

![Deprecation Warnings](docs/images/deprecations.png)

![N+1 Query Patterns](docs/images/n-plus-one-queries.png)

Requires breadcrumbs to be enabled. Deprecations are seen only when the host's `ActiveSupport::Deprecation` behaviour includes `:notify` (the production default does not) and only inside requests that later raised.

[Complete documentation →](docs/FEATURES.md#n1-query-detection)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Operational Health Panels — Jobs, Database, Cache, ActionCable</strong></summary>

**Job Health** — Aggregates the queue stats captured on each error (Sidekiq, SolidQueue or GoodJob auto-detected; needs `enable_system_health`). Not a live queue view — a per-error table with adapter badge, failed count (color-coded), sorted worst-first.

![Job Health](docs/images/job-health.png)

**Database Health** — PgHero-style live PostgreSQL stats (table sizes, unused indexes, dead tuples, vacuum timestamps) plus historical connection pool data from error snapshots. PostgreSQL-only for the system-table views; MySQL and SQLite show connection pool stats and hide the rest.

![Database Health](docs/images/database-health.png)

**Cache Health** — Per-error cache performance sorted worst-first.

![Cache Health](docs/images/cache-health.png)

**ActionCable Health** — Track WebSocket channel actions, transmissions, subscription confirmations, and rejections. Dashboard page at `/errors/actioncable_health_summary` with channel breakdown sorted by rejections. System health snapshot captures live connection count and adapter.

```ruby
config.enable_actioncable_tracking = true  # requires enable_breadcrumbs = true
```

**ActiveStorage Health** — Track file uploads, downloads, deletes, and existence checks across storage services (Disk, S3, GCS, Azure — any ActiveStorage backend). Dashboard page at `/errors/activestorage_health_summary` with per-service operation counts, average and slowest durations. Helps identify slow storage operations correlating with errors.

```ruby
config.enable_activestorage_tracking = true  # requires enable_breadcrumbs = true
```

<details>
<summary><strong>LLM Observability — Calls, Tokens, Cost, Tool Use</strong></summary>

Capture your app's LLM calls — through a Faraday middleware, OpenTelemetry GenAI spans or a manual notification; nothing is auto-instrumented — as breadcrumbs on the error that follows, with model, latency, token counts, estimated USD cost and tool-use requests. When a request crashes, you see the chat completion that preceded it: which model was called, how long it took, what it cost, and which tools it asked to invoke.

- Three capture paths — pick whichever matches your stack
- Cost estimated from a built-in pricing table (Claude 4.x, GPT-4o/o1, Gemini 2.5) — override per-model via `config.llm_pricing_overrides`
- Tool-call requests summarized inline; tool *execution* spans captured separately via the OTel path
- Prompts and completions are **never recorded** — only token counts and metadata (the `llm_observability_content_capture` flag is reserved and currently a no-op)
- Same host-app safety guarantees as the rest of the gem — never raises, never blocks the request, every callback rescue-wrapped

```ruby
config.enable_breadcrumbs        = true   # required — LLM crumbs ride the breadcrumb pipeline
config.enable_llm_observability  = true
# Optional — override the built-in pricing table for your account
# config.llm_pricing_overrides = { "claude-sonnet-4-6" => { input: 3.0, output: 15.0 } }
```

**Path A — `ruby-openai` (Faraday middleware)**

```ruby
# Gemfile already has: gem "ruby-openai"
client = OpenAI::Client.new do |f|
  f.use RailsErrorDashboard::Integrations::LlmMiddleware
end
```

**Path B — `ruby_llm` (OpenTelemetry)**

`ruby_llm` doesn't expose a Faraday hook, but the thoughtbot OTel instrumentation gem emits GenAI-semconv spans that our SpanProcessor picks up automatically.

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "ruby_llm"
gem "opentelemetry-sdk"
gem "opentelemetry-instrumentation-ruby_llm"

# config/initializers/opentelemetry.rb
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use "OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::RubyLLM"
end
```

The dashboard's `LlmSpanProcessor` registers itself with `OpenTelemetry.tracer_provider` during engine boot — no extra wiring.

**Path C — anything else (Anthropic official SDK, Net::HTTP, gRPC, Ollama, …)**

The official `anthropic` gem uses `Net::HTTP` directly (no Faraday hook), and many local-inference setups don't run OTel. Wrap any LLM call in `ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument` — pass a mutable Hash so token counts can be filled in *after* the call:

```ruby
payload = { provider: "anthropic", model: "claude-sonnet-4-6" }

ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument("red.llm_call", payload) do
  response = Anthropic::Client.new.messages.create(
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    messages: [ { role: "user", content: "hi" } ]
  )
  payload[:input_tokens]  = response.usage.input_tokens
  payload[:output_tokens] = response.usage.output_tokens
end

# Tool execution — captured as its own llm_tool breadcrumb
ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument("red.llm_tool_call",
  tool_name: "search_database",
  tool_arguments: { query: "..." }
) do
  # run the tool
end
```

Payload contract matches the `LlmCallEvent` value object — see [`docs/LLM_OBSERVABILITY.md`](docs/LLM_OBSERVABILITY.md) for the full field list.

<details>
<summary><strong>Issue Tracking — GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, Linear</strong></summary>

One switch connects errors to your issue tracker. Platform becomes the source of truth — status, assignees, labels, and comments are mirrored live in the dashboard.

- **Create & link:** "Create Issue" button or paste an existing URL
- **Auto-create:** New errors auto-create issues. Critical/high severity always creates
- **Lifecycle sync:** Resolve → close, recur → reopen + comment, all via background jobs
- **Platform mirror:** Issue state, assignees (with avatars), labels (with colors), and comments displayed in the dashboard. Workflow controls (Resolve, Assign, Priority) replaced by platform state
- **Two-way webhooks:** Issue closed/reopened on platform syncs back to dashboard
- **RED branding:** Issues show "Created by RED (Rails Error Dashboard)"

```ruby
config.enable_issue_tracking = true
config.issue_tracker_token = ENV["RED_BOT_TOKEN"]
# That's it — provider and repo auto-detected from git_repository_url
```

Linear works too — it's not a git forge, so set the provider and team key explicitly:

```ruby
config.enable_issue_tracking = true
config.issue_tracker_provider = :linear
config.issue_tracker_repo = "ENG"  # Linear team key (issues land as ENG-123)
config.issue_tracker_token = ENV["RED_BOT_TOKEN"]  # lin_api_... personal API key
```

Closing maps to the team's first `completed` workflow state, reopening to `unstarted`/`backlog`. Two-way sync uses Linear webhooks (`Linear-Signature` HMAC verification).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>User Impact Scoring</strong></summary>

Dedicated `/errors/user_impact` page ranking errors by unique users affected — not occurrence count. An error hitting 1000 users once ranks higher than hitting 1 user 1000 times. Shows impact percentage (when `total_users_for_impact` is configured or auto-detected), severity badges, and per-error drill-down links.

No configuration needed — works automatically when errors have `user_id` (auto-detected via `CurrentAttributes` or `current_user`).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Scheduled Digests</strong></summary>

Daily or weekly error summary emails — new errors, resolution rate, top errors by count, critical unresolved, and period-over-period comparison. HTML + text templates. Users schedule the job via SolidQueue, Sidekiq, or cron.

```ruby
config.enable_scheduled_digests = true
config.digest_frequency = :daily  # or :weekly
# config.digest_recipients = ["team@example.com"]  # defaults to notification_email_recipients
```

Schedule: `rails error_dashboard:send_digest PERIOD=daily`
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Release Tracking</strong></summary>

Dedicated Releases page at `/errors/releases` shows a timeline of all deploys/versions with health stats. Answers: "Did this deploy introduce new errors?" and "Is this release stable?"

- **Release timeline:** Every version seen, sorted newest-first, with error counts, unique types, and time range
- **"New in this release":** Errors whose fingerprint first appeared in each version — flagged with a red badge
- **Stability indicators:** Green (at or below average), yellow (1-2x), red (>2x average error rate)
- **Release comparison:** Delta and percentage change vs the previous release
- **Current release:** Highlighted card with live health stats
- **Zero config:** Works automatically when `app_version` or `git_sha` is set (via config, `APP_VERSION`, `GIT_SHA`, `HEROKU_SLUG_COMMIT`, or `RENDER_GIT_COMMIT` env vars)

```ruby
config.app_version = "1.2.0"           # or set APP_VERSION env var
config.git_sha = ENV["GIT_SHA"]        # auto-detected on Heroku/Render
config.git_repository_url = "https://github.com/user/repo"  # enables SHA links
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Source Code Integration + Git Blame</strong></summary>

View actual source code directly in error backtraces with +/-7 lines of context. Git blame shows who last modified the code, when, and the commit message. Repository links jump to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket at the exact line.

```ruby
config.enable_source_code_integration = true
config.enable_git_blame = true
```

[Complete documentation →](docs/SOURCE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Code Path Coverage (Diagnostic Mode)</strong></summary>

Enable coverage via a dashboard button to see which production code paths were executed. Source code viewer overlays green checkmarks on executed lines and gray dots on unexecuted lines. Uses Ruby's `Coverage.setup(oneshot_lines: true)` — near-zero overhead, each line fires once. Zero overhead when off. Diagnostic mode only: coverage is process-global (a multi-threaded Puma blends requests), held in memory and not persisted. No error tracker integrates this; Coverband does it standalone with persistence.

```ruby
config.enable_coverage_tracking = true   # shows Enable/Disable buttons on error detail page
config.enable_source_code_integration = true  # required for source code viewer
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>AI Help + Error Replay — Ask, Copy as cURL / RSpec / LLM Markdown</strong></summary>

Replay failing requests with one click. Copy the request as a cURL command, generate an RSpec test, or **copy all error details as clean Markdown** for pasting into an LLM session. The LLM export includes app backtrace, cause chain, local/instance variables, breadcrumbs, environment, system health, and related errors — with framework frames filtered and sensitive data preserved as `[FILTERED]`.

When an LLM provider is configured, the error detail page also shows an **AI Help** drawer. Users can ask follow-up questions about the current error and receive streamed Markdown answers from OpenAI or Anthropic without leaving the dashboard.

```ruby
config.llm_provider = :openai # or :anthropic
config.llm_api_key = -> { Rails.application.credentials.dig(:openai, :api_key) }
config.llm_model = "gpt-5"
```

> **Privacy:** AI Help sends the error's details (backtrace, context, and your question) to the configured provider (OpenAI or Anthropic). Keep `config.filter_sensitive_data = true` (the default) so sensitive values are redacted as `[FILTERED]` before they leave your app.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Notifications — Slack, Discord, PagerDuty, Email, Webhooks</strong></summary>

Multi-channel alerting with severity filters, per-error cooldown, milestone threshold alerts, and a per-environment allowlist (`config.notification_environments = %w[production]`) so a staging deploy never pages anyone.

```ruby
config.enable_slack_notifications = true
config.slack_webhook_url = ENV['SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL']
```

[Notification setup guide →](docs/guides/NOTIFICATIONS.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Environment Awareness — Filter, Badge, Notify per Environment</strong></summary>

Every error records the environment it came from — `production`, `staging`, `uat`, `preprod`, any name your deploys use. The errors index filters by it, rows and the detail page carry a badge, the analytics page breaks errors down by environment, and every notification names it. The same error in staging and production is two rows with independent status, so resolving one never hides the other.

```ruby
config.environment = ENV.fetch("ERROR_DASHBOARD_ENVIRONMENT", Rails.env)  # free-form, defaults to Rails.env
config.notification_environments = %w[production]                         # nil = notify everywhere
```

Errors captured before v0.11.0 show no badge until they recur (the next occurrence claims the row) or you run `rails rails_error_dashboard:backfill_environments`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Advanced Analytics</strong></summary>

![Analytics](docs/images/analytics.png)

Seven analysis engines built in:

1. **Baseline Anomaly Alerts** — Statistical spike detection (mean + std dev) with intelligent cooldown
2. **Fuzzy Error Matching** — Jaccard similarity + Levenshtein distance to find related errors
3. **Co-occurring Errors** — Detect errors that happen together within configurable time windows
4. **Error Cascade Detection** — Identify potential cascades (A is followed by B is followed by C) with probability and delays — temporal association, not proven causation
5. **Error Correlation Analysis** — Correlate errors with app versions, git commits, and users
6. **Platform Comparison** — iOS vs Android vs API health metrics side-by-side
7. **Occurrence Pattern Detection** — Cyclical patterns (business hours, weekends) and burst detection

<summary><strong>Local Variable + Instance Variable Capture</strong></summary>

See the values of local variables and instance variables at the moment an exception was raised — the most valuable debugging context possible.

- TracePoint(`:raise`) captures locals and ivars before the stack unwinds
- Strings, arrays and hashes are snapshotted at raise time (one level deep, bounded by the limits below), so an `ensure` block that cleans up state does not overwrite what you see. Other objects are kept by reference and show their state at serialization time
- Configurable limits: max variable count, nesting depth, string truncation length
- Sensitive data auto-filtered via Rails `filter_parameters` — passwords, tokens, and PII never stored
- Never stores Binding objects — values extracted immediately, Binding is GC'd
- Independent config flags: enable one or both

![Local Variables](docs/images/local-variables.png)

```ruby
config.enable_local_variables = true
config.enable_instance_variables = true

<details>
<summary><strong>Swallowed Exception Detection</strong></summary>

Detect exceptions that are raised but silently rescued — the hardest bugs to find. Only Datadog's paid APM detects rescued exceptions (Ruby 3.3+, and only inside a traced request); RED does it free, without an APM span, and aggregates the raise-vs-rescue ratio per location — no other tracker does that.

- Uses TracePoint(`:raise`) + TracePoint(`:rescue`) to track exception lifecycle
- Identifies code paths where exceptions are caught but never logged or re-raised
- Dashboard page at `/errors/swallowed_exceptions` shows detection counts, locations, and patterns
- Memory-bounded aggregation with background flush
- Requires Ruby 3.3+

![Swallowed Exceptions](docs/images/swallowed-exceptions.png)

```ruby
config.detect_swallowed_exceptions = true
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>On-Demand Diagnostic Dump</strong></summary>

Snapshot your app's entire system state on demand — environment, GC stats, threads, connection pool, memory, job queue health, and more.

- Trigger via dashboard button or `rake rails_error_dashboard:diagnostic_dump`
- Dashboard page at `/errors/diagnostic_dumps` with full history
- Useful for debugging intermittent production issues without reproducing them

![Diagnostic Dumps](docs/images/diagnostic-dumps.png)

```ruby
config.enable_diagnostic_dump = true
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Rack Attack Event Tracking</strong></summary>

Track Rack Attack security events (throttles, blocklists, tracks) as breadcrumbs attached to errors, with a dedicated summary page.

- Captures throttle, blocklist, and track events automatically
- Dashboard page at `/errors/rack_attack_summary` with event breakdown and per-rule stats — rack-attack ships no UI of its own
- Classifies AI-agent user agents (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, …) on `track` events
- Requires breadcrumbs to be enabled

```ruby
config.enable_rack_attack_tracking = true
```

[Complete documentation →](docs/FEATURES.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Process Crash Capture</strong></summary>

Capture unhandled exceptions that crash the Ruby process via an `at_exit` hook — the last line of defense.

- Disk-based fallback: writes crash data to disk because the database may be unavailable during shutdown
- Imported automatically on next boot
- Captures exception details, backtrace, uptime, GC stats, thread count, and cause chain
- Honeybadger, Bugsnag and AppSignal have `at_exit` reporters too; RED's writes to disk and imports at next boot because the database may already be gone during shutdown

<summary><strong>OpenTelemetry Export — Emit Gem Operations as Spans</strong></summary>

Send the gem's error-capture pipeline as OpenTelemetry spans to your existing Datadog, Honeycomb, or Jaeger collector. Each stage of the capture path — DB write, breadcrumb harvest, system health snapshot, and notification dispatch — becomes a named child span so you can audit gem overhead from your own observability dashboards.

- Off by default — zero impact unless you opt in
- No-op when the OTel API gem isn't loaded
- Per-span-kind opt-in: enable only the stages you care about
- Every span individually rescue-wrapped — never raises into host code
- Boot-time warning if `enable_otel_export = true` but `opentelemetry-api` isn't in the Gemfile

```ruby
# Gemfile — only the API gem is required; the SDK is optional
gem "opentelemetry-api"

# config/initializers/rails_error_dashboard.rb
config.enable_otel_export  = true
config.otel_service_name   = "my-app"   # falls back to application_name
config.otel_spans          = [:capture, :breadcrumbs, :health, :notifications]  # all (default)
# config.otel_spans        = [:capture]                                          # parent span only
```

Span names follow the `rails_error_dashboard.<operation>` convention, e.g. `rails_error_dashboard.capture_error`. Both attributes are attached to every span: `rails_error_dashboard.version` and `rails_error_dashboard.service_name` — use them to filter the gem's traffic in your dashboards.

## Quick Start

### 1. Add to Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'rails_error_dashboard'
```

RED requires Rails 7.0 or newer, Ruby 3.2 or newer, `pagy ~> 43` and `groupdate ~> 6`. An app that pins an older Pagy or groupdate must upgrade it first, or `bundle install` fails.

- **Rails before 8.1.4 or 7.2.4** (every 8.0, 7.1 and 7.0 release): also add `gem "json", "< 3"`. json 3 breaks those Rails versions, and the dashboard returns 500. See [the json pin](docs/UPGRADING.md#rails-before-814-or-724-pin-json-below-3).
- **MySQL**: load the time-zone tables (`mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -u root mysql`), or the charts fail.

### 2. Install with Interactive Setup

```bash
bundle install
rails generate rails_error_dashboard:install
rails db:migrate
```

The installer asks about notifications and advanced analytics, then where to store errors: in your app's database (the default), a separate one, or one shared by several apps. Without a terminal (CI, Docker) it asks nothing: async logging is on, and every other optional feature is off.

**Chose a separate or shared database?** Add the `config/database.yml` entry the installer prints, then run `bin/rails db:create` before `db:migrate`. See [Database Options](docs/guides/DATABASE_OPTIONS.md).

### 3. Visit your dashboard

```
http://localhost:3000/red
```

Default credentials: `gandalf` / `youshallnotpass`, for development and test only.

**Before you deploy anywhere else**, set `ERROR_DASHBOARD_USER` and `ERROR_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` in that environment. Outside development and test, the app refuses to boot on the defaults. See [Dashboard Credentials](docs/guides/CONFIGURATION.md#dashboard-credentials). For the rest of what production needs (a worker, scheduled jobs, migrations on deploy), see [Running in Production](docs/PRODUCTION.md).

### 4. Test it out

Open `/red/settings` and click **Send Test Error**, or raise an exception in any controller action. Errors raised at the Rails console prompt are not captured. To report one from the console, use:

```ruby
Rails.error.report(RuntimeError.new("Test error from Rails Error Dashboard"), handled: false)
```

With async logging on (the default), leave the console open for a second or two so the background job can write it.

[Full installation guide →](docs/QUICKSTART.md)

### Upgrading

```bash
bundle update rails_error_dashboard
bin/rails generate rails_error_dashboard:install --no-interactive
bin/rails db:migrate
```

The installer keeps your initializer and copies only the new migrations. Some releases need a step of their own, and two of them can stop an app booting: [read the upgrade guide](docs/UPGRADING.md) before you deploy.

## Configuration

```ruby
RailsErrorDashboard.configure do |config|
  # Dashboard login: set ERROR_DASHBOARD_USER and ERROR_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD outside
  # development and test (the gem reads them itself). Or use your existing auth:
  # config.authenticate_with = -> { warden.authenticated? }

  # Optional features — enable as needed
  config.enable_slack_notifications = true
  config.slack_webhook_url = ENV['SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL']
  config.async_logging = true  # jobs run on your app's Active Job adapter; production needs a worker
end
```

**Multi-App Support** — Track errors from multiple Rails apps in a single shared database. Auto-detects app name, supports per-app filtering. [Multi-App guide →](docs/MULTI_APP_PERFORMANCE.md)

**OpenTelemetry Export** — Emit error-capture operations as OTel spans to Datadog, Honeycomb, or Jaeger. Add `gem "opentelemetry-api"` and set `config.enable_otel_export = true`. See **OpenTelemetry Export** under [Features](#features) above for the full options.

## Languages

RED ships in English, with French reviewed by a native speaker and machine-translated previews for nine further languages, covering the dashboard, its emails and its notification payloads. Native-speaking Rails developers are invited to review and improve them; once a locale has been reviewed it is marked individually as community-reviewed, as French now is. Eleven locales ship:

| Locale | Language | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `en` | English | Source language |
| `de` | Deutsch | Machine-translated, unreviewed |
| `es` | Español | Machine-translated, unreviewed |
| `fr` | Français | Community-reviewed by a native speaker |
| `pt-BR` | Português (Brasil) | Machine-translated, unreviewed |
| `ja` | 日本語 | Machine-translated, unreviewed |
| `ru` | Русский | Machine-translated, unreviewed |
| `uk` | Українська | Machine-translated, unreviewed |
| `pl` | Polski | Machine-translated, unreviewed |
| `it` | Italiano | Machine-translated, unreviewed |
| `zh-CN` | 简体中文 | Machine-translated, unreviewed |

```ruby
config.dashboard_locale = "de"  # en, de, es, fr, pt-BR, ja, ru, uk, pl, it, zh-CN — default "en"
```

Users can also switch language per-session from the picker in the dashboard navbar, which overrides the configured default for them alone.

**French has been reviewed by a native speaker; everything but English and French is machine-translated and has not been.** That is stated plainly rather than as "beta", which would imply a review process that has not happened — RED's maintainer reads only English. Key structure, interpolation variables and plural categories *are* verified mechanically in every locale; outside French, wording, register and idiom are not verified by anyone. A wrong or missing translation falls back to **English**, never to a broken page.

**Corrections are very welcome, and a one-key PR is a perfectly good PR.** If you read one of these languages, [every unreviewed locale has an open issue](https://github.com/AnjanJ/rails_error_dashboard/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atranslation%3Aneeds-review) tracking its review — comment there, or [report a bad translation](https://github.com/AnjanJ/rails_error_dashboard/issues/new?template=translation_report.yml) without touching any code. You do not need to know Ruby, and you are not expected to review a whole file.

RED translates through its own private I18n backend, so it never reads, writes or mutates your application's `I18n` configuration — your locale and its `available_locales` are untouched.

## FAQ

**Does Rails Error Dashboard support a separate database for errors?**
Yes. You can store errors in your app's existing database **or** in a dedicated one. Choose it at the installer's database prompt (or pass `--separate-database`), then add the `error_dashboard` entry it prints to `config/database.yml` for every environment. The engine routes all of its tables through `connects_to`, keeping error data isolated from your app data. Both modes are first-class and covered by the [Database Options guide](docs/guides/DATABASE_OPTIONS.md).

**Which databases does it work with?**
SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL/Trilogy — in either shared or separate-database mode.

**Is this a self-hosted alternative to Sentry?**
Yes. It runs entirely inside your own Rails process — no external services, no SDK calling out, no per-event pricing. Error data never leaves your infrastructure.

**Does it capture local variables like Sentry?**
Yes — local **and** instance variables at the moment the exception is raised, via `TracePoint(:raise)`, with sensitive-data filtering and configurable limits. It is opt-in. (Sentry's SDK can also capture locals as an opt-in option; RED adds instance variables and applies your Rails `filter_parameters` automatically.)

**Will a flood of errors take down my app?**
No. Storm protection (a circuit breaker with adaptive sampling, **ON by default**) makes the gem degrade itself first during error floods — occurrence counts stay exact while it sheds the expensive work, and a Storm History page shows exactly what was shed. There is no I/O on the hot path — the check is a digest and an atomic increment.

**Does it work with my background jobs?**
Yes — errors raised in jobs are captured, and it can log errors asynchronously through your app's Active Job adapter (Sidekiq, Solid Queue, GoodJob or the in-process `:async`). In production, run a worker for the `default` and `error_notifications` queues. Sidekiq, Solid Queue and GoodJob are all auto-detected for the job-queue stats stored on each error.

**Does it work with my authentication?**
Yes — HTTP Basic Auth out of the box, or a custom `authenticate_with` lambda that integrates with Devise, Warden, or session-based auth.

**Can it track more than one app?**
Yes — apps that point at the same error database share one dashboard, with per-app filtering.

**What Rails and Ruby versions are supported?**
Rails 7.0–8.1 and Ruby 3.2–4.0.

## Architecture

Built with **CQRS (Command/Query Responsibility Segregation)**:
- **Commands** — LogError, ResolveError, BatchOperations (writes)
- **Queries** — ErrorsList, DashboardStats, Analytics (reads)
- **Services** — PlatformDetector, SimilarityCalculator (business logic)
- **Plugins** — Event-driven extensibility

---

## Testing

An RSpec suite of unit, request and browser-based system specs runs in CI on every supported Rails version (see the Tests badge above); the current count lives in the CI log rather than here, where it would go stale.

```bash
bundle exec rspec                              # Full suite
bundle exec rspec spec/system/                 # System tests (Capybara + Cuprite)
HEADLESS=false bundle exec rspec spec/system/  # Visible browser
```
