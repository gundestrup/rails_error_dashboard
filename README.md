Automatically detect unusual error rate spikes using statistical analysis (mean + std dev). Get proactive notifications when errors exceed expected baselines with intelligent cooldown to avoid alert fatigue.

**2. Fuzzy Error Matching** 🔍
Find similar errors across different error hashes using Jaccard similarity (70%) and Levenshtein distance (30%). Discover related errors that share common root causes even when they manifest differently.

**3. Co-occurring Errors** 🔗
Detect errors that happen together within configurable time windows (default: 5 minutes). Identify patterns where one error frequently triggers another, helping you prioritize fixes.

**4. Error Cascade Detection** ⛓️
Identify error chains (A causes B causes C) with probability calculations and average delays. Visualize parent→child relationships to understand cascading failures and fix root causes.

**5. Error Correlation Analysis** 📊
Correlate errors with app versions, git commits, and users. Find problematic releases, identify users affected by multiple error types, and detect time-based patterns.

**6. Platform Comparison** 📱
Compare iOS vs Android vs Web health metrics side-by-side. Platform-specific error rates, severity distributions, resolution times, and stability scores (0-100).

**7. Occurrence Pattern Detection** 📈
Detect cyclical patterns (business hours, nighttime, weekend rhythms) and error bursts (many errors in short time). Understand when and how your errors happen.

**8. Developer Insights** 💡
AI-powered insights with severity detection, platform stability scoring, actionable recommendations, and recent error activity summaries.

#### 🔌 Plugin System
Extensible architecture with event hooks (`on_error_logged`, `on_error_resolved`, `on_threshold_exceeded`). Built-in examples for Jira integration, metrics tracking, audit logging. Easy to create custom plugins - just drop a file in `config/initializers/error_dashboard_plugins/`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Opt-in Feature System

Rails Error Dashboard uses an **opt-in architecture** - core features (error capture, dashboard UI, analytics) are always enabled, while everything else is disabled by default.

**Tier 1 Features (Always ON)**:
- ✅ Error capture (controllers, jobs, middleware)
- ✅ Dashboard UI with search and filtering
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ Analytics and trend charts

**Optional Features (Choose During Install)**:
- 📧 Multi-channel notifications (Slack, Email, Discord, PagerDuty, Webhooks)
- ⚡ Performance optimizations (Async logging, Error sampling)
- 📊 Advanced analytics (Baseline alerts, Fuzzy matching, Platform comparison, and more)

### Basic Configuration

Edit `config/initializers/rails_error_dashboard.rb`:

```ruby
RailsErrorDashboard.configure do |config|
  # ============================================================================
  # AUTHENTICATION (Always Required)
  # ============================================================================
  config.dashboard_username = ENV.fetch('ERROR_DASHBOARD_USER', 'gandalf')
  config.dashboard_password = ENV.fetch('ERROR_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD', 'youshallnotpass')

  # ============================================================================
  # OPTIONAL FEATURES (Enable as needed)
  # ============================================================================

  # Slack notifications (if enabled during install)
  config.enable_slack_notifications = true
  config.slack_webhook_url = ENV['SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL']

  # Email notifications (if enabled during install)
  config.enable_email_notifications = true
  config.notification_email_recipients = ["dev@yourapp.com"]
  config.notification_email_from = "errors@yourapp.com"

  # Async logging for better performance (if enabled during install)
  config.async_logging = true
  config.async_adapter = :sidekiq  # or :solid_queue, :async

  # Advanced analytics features (if enabled during install)
  config.enable_baseline_alerts = true
  config.enable_similar_errors = true
  config.enable_platform_comparison = true
end
```

All features can be toggled on/off at any time by editing the initializer.

### Environment Variables

```bash
# .env
ERROR_DASHBOARD_USER=your_username
ERROR_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
DASHBOARD_BASE_URL=https://yourapp.com
```

**📖 [Complete configuration guide →](docs/guides/CONFIGURATION.md)**

## 🏢 Multi-App Support

**Rails Error Dashboard supports logging errors from multiple Rails applications to a single shared database.**

This is ideal for:
- Managing errors across microservices
- Monitoring production, staging, and development environments separately
- Tracking different apps from a central dashboard
- Organizations running multiple Rails applications

### Automatic Configuration

By default, the dashboard automatically detects your application name from `Rails.application.class.module_parent_name`:

```ruby
# BlogApp::Application → "BlogApp"
# AdminPanel::Application → "AdminPanel"
# ApiService::Application → "ApiService"
```

**No configuration needed!** Each app will automatically register itself when logging its first error.

### Manual Override

Override the auto-detected name if desired:

```ruby
# config/initializers/rails_error_dashboard.rb
RailsErrorDashboard.configure do |config|
  config.application_name = "MyCustomAppName"
end
```

Or use an environment variable:

```bash
# .env
APPLICATION_NAME="Production API"
```

This allows you to use different names for different environments:
```bash
# Production
APPLICATION_NAME="MyApp-Production"

# Staging
APPLICATION_NAME="MyApp-Staging"

# Development
APPLICATION_NAME="MyApp-Development"
```

### Shared Database Setup

All apps must use the same error dashboard database. Configure your `database.yml`:

```yaml
# config/database.yml
production:
  primary:
    database: my_app_production
    # ... other connection settings

  error_dashboard:
    database: shared_error_dashboard_production
    host: error-db.example.com
    # ... other connection settings
```

Then in your initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/rails_error_dashboard.rb
RailsErrorDashboard.configure do |config|
  config.database = :error_dashboard  # Use the shared database
end
```

### Dashboard UI Features

**Navbar Application Switcher:**
- Quick dropdown to switch between applications
- Shows "All Apps" by default
- Only appears when multiple apps are registered

**Filter Form:**
- Filter errors by specific application
- Combine with other filters (error type, platform, etc.)
- Active filter pills show current selection

**Application Column:**
- Displays application name for each error
- Only shown when viewing "All Apps"
- Hidden when filtered to a single app

### Per-App Error Tracking

Errors are tracked independently per application:

```ruby
# Same error in different apps creates separate records
# App A: StandardError "Database timeout" → Error #1
# App B: StandardError "Database timeout" → Error #2

# Each has its own:
# - Occurrence counts
# - Resolution status
# - Comments and history
# - Analytics and trends
```

### API Usage

When logging errors via API, specify the application:

```ruby
RailsErrorDashboard::Commands::LogError.call(
  error_type: "TypeError",
  message: "Cannot read property 'name' of null",
  platform: "iOS",
  # ... other parameters
)
# Uses config.application_name automatically
```

Or override per-error (advanced):

```ruby
# Create application first
app = RailsErrorDashboard::Application.find_or_create_by!(name: "Mobile App")

# Then create error
RailsErrorDashboard::ErrorLog.create!(
  application: app,
  error_type: "NetworkError",
  message: "Request failed",
  # ... other fields
)
```

### Performance & Concurrency

Multi-app support is designed for high-concurrency scenarios:

✅ **Row-level locking** - No table locks, apps write independently
✅ **Cached lookups** - Application names cached for 1 hour
✅ **Composite indexes** - Fast filtering on `[application_id, occurred_at]`
✅ **Per-app deduplication** - Same error in different apps tracked separately
✅ **No deadlocks** - Scoped locking prevents cross-app conflicts

**Benchmark**: Tested with 5 apps writing 1000 errors/sec with zero deadlocks.

### Rake Tasks

Manage applications via rake tasks:

```bash
# List all registered applications
rails error_dashboard:list_applications

# Backfill application for existing errors
rails error_dashboard:backfill_application APP_NAME="Legacy App"
```

### Migration Guide

If you have existing errors before enabling multi-app support:

1. Run migrations: `rails db:migrate`
2. Backfill existing errors:
   ```bash
   rails error_dashboard:backfill_application APP_NAME="My App"
   ```
3. All existing errors will be assigned to "My App"
4. New applications will auto-register on first error

**Zero downtime** - Errors can continue logging during migration.

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Automatic Error Tracking

Rails Error Dashboard automatically tracks errors from:
- **Controllers** (via Rails error reporting)
- **Background jobs** (ActiveJob, Sidekiq)
- **Rack middleware** (catches everything else)

No additional code needed! Just install and it works.

### Manual Error Logging

For frontend/mobile apps or custom error logging:

```ruby
# From your Rails API
RailsErrorDashboard::Commands::LogError.call(
  error_type: "TypeError",
  message: "Cannot read property 'name' of null",
  backtrace: ["App.js:42", "index.js:12"],
  platform: "iOS",
  app_version: "2.1.0",
  user_id: current_user.id,
  context: {
    component: "ProfileScreen",
    device_model: "iPhone 14 Pro"
  }
)
```

### Frontend Integration

```javascript
// React Native example
try {
  // Your code
} catch (error) {
  fetch('https://yourapp.com/api/errors', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      error_type: error.name,
      message: error.message,
      backtrace: error.stack.split('\n'),
      platform: Platform.OS, // 'ios' or 'android'
      app_version: VERSION
    })
  });
}
```
