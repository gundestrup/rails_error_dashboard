## Self-hosted Rails error monitoring — free, forever.

**Own your errors. Own your stack. Zero monthly fees.**

A fully open-source, self-hosted error dashboard for solo founders, indie hackers, and small teams who want complete control without the SaaS bills.

```ruby
gem 'rails_error_dashboard'
```

**5-minute setup** · **Works out-of-the-box** · **100% Rails + Postgres** · **No vendor lock-in**

---

### ⚠️ BETA SOFTWARE
This Rails Engine is in beta and under active development. While functional and tested (850+ tests passing), the API may change before v1.0.0. Use in production at your own discretion.

**Supports**: Rails 7.0 - 8.1 | Ruby 3.2+

---

## 🎯 Who This Is For

✓ **Solo bootstrappers** who need professional error tracking without recurring costs

✓ **Indie SaaS founders** building profitable apps on tight budgets

✓ **Small dev teams** (2-5 people) who hate SaaS bloat

✓ **Privacy-conscious apps** that need to keep error data on their own servers

✓ **Side projects** that might become real businesses

---

## 💰 What It Replaces

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Pay $29-99/month for error monitoring | $0/month - runs on your existing Rails server |
| Send sensitive error data to third parties | Keep all data on your infrastructure |
| Fight with SaaS pricing tiers and limits | Unlimited errors, unlimited projects |
| Vendor lock-in with proprietary APIs | 100% open source, fully portable |

Error assignment and status tracking, priority levels (critical/high/medium/low), snooze functionality, comment threads, batch operations (bulk resolve/delete), resolution tracking with references.

#### 🔒 Security & Privacy
HTTP Basic Auth, environment-based settings, optional separate database for isolation. Your data stays on your server - no third-party access.

### Optional Features (Choose During Install)

#### 🚨 Multi-Channel Notifications

- **Slack** - Rich formatted messages with error context and direct dashboard links
- **Email** - HTML formatted alerts with full error details
- **Discord** - Embedded messages with severity color coding
- **PagerDuty** - Critical error escalation with incident management
- **Webhooks** - Custom integrations with any service (JSON payloads)

#### ⚡ Performance Optimizations

- **Error Sampling** - Reduce storage by sampling high-frequency errors
- **Backtrace Limiting** - Save 70-90% storage with smart truncation
- **Separate Database** - Isolate error data for better performance
- **Database Indexes** - Composite indexes and PostgreSQL GIN full-text search

#### 🧠 Advanced Analytics (8 Powerful Features)

**1. Baseline Anomaly Alerts** 🔔
Automatically detect unusual error rate spikes using statistical analysis (mean + std dev). Get proactive notifications when errors exceed expected baselines with intelligent cooldown to avoid alert fatigue.

**2. Fuzzy Error Matching** 🔍
Find similar errors across different error hashes using Jaccard similarity (70%) and Levenshtein distance (30%). Discover related errors that share common root causes even when they manifest differently.

**3. Co-occurring Errors** 🔗
Detect errors that happen together within configurable time windows (default: 5 minutes). Identify patterns where one error frequently triggers another, helping you prioritize fixes.

**4. Error Cascade Detection** ⛓️
Identify error chains (A causes B causes C) with probability calculations and average delays. Visualize parent→child relationships to understand cascading failures and fix root causes.

**5. Error Correlation Analysis** 📊
Correlate errors with app versions, git commits, and users. Find problematic releases, identify users affected by multiple error types, and detect time-based patterns.

**6. Platform Comparison** 📱
Compare iOS vs Android vs Web health metrics side-by-side. Platform-specific error rates, severity distributions, resolution times, and stability scores (0-100).

**7. Occurrence Pattern Detection** 📈
Detect cyclical patterns (business hours, nighttime, weekend rhythms) and error bursts (many errors in short time). Understand when and how your errors happen.

**8. Developer Insights** 💡
AI-powered insights with severity detection, platform stability scoring, actionable recommendations, and recent error activity summaries.

#### 🔌 Plugin System
Extensible architecture with event hooks (`on_error_logged`, `on_error_resolved`, `on_threshold_exceeded`). Built-in examples for Jira integration, metrics tracking, audit logging. Easy to create custom plugins - just drop a file in `config/initializers/error_dashboard_plugins/`.

## 📦 Quick Start

### 1. Add to Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'rails_error_dashboard'
```

```bash
bundle install
rails generate rails_error_dashboard:install
rails db:migrate
```

The installer will guide you through optional feature selection:
- **Notifications** (Slack, Email, Discord, PagerDuty, Webhooks)
- **Performance** (Async Logging, Error Sampling, Separate Database)
- **Advanced Analytics** (8 powerful features including baseline alerts, fuzzy matching, platform comparison)

**All features are opt-in** - choose what you need during installation, or enable/disable them later in the initializer.

This will:
- Create `config/initializers/rails_error_dashboard.rb` with your selected features
- Copy database migrations
- Mount the engine at `/error_dashboard`

### 3. Visit your dashboard

Start your server and visit:
```
http://localhost:3000/error_dashboard
```

**Default credentials:**
- Username: `gandalf`
- Password: `youshallnotpass`

⚠️ **Change these before production!** Edit `config/initializers/rails_error_dashboard.rb`

### 4. Test it out

Trigger a test error to see it in action:

```ruby
# In Rails console or any controller
raise "Test error from Rails Error Dashboard!"
```

The error will appear instantly in your dashboard with full context, backtrace, and platform information.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Opt-in Feature System

Rails Error Dashboard uses an **opt-in architecture** - core features (error capture, dashboard UI, analytics) are always enabled, while everything else is disabled by default.

**Tier 1 Features (Always ON)**:
- ✅ Error capture (controllers, jobs, middleware)
- ✅ Dashboard UI with search and filtering
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ Analytics and trend charts

**Optional Features (Choose During Install)**:
- 📧 Multi-channel notifications (Slack, Email, Discord, PagerDuty, Webhooks)
- ⚡ Performance optimizations (Async logging, Error sampling)
- 📊 Advanced analytics (Baseline alerts, Fuzzy matching, Platform comparison, and more)

### Basic Configuration

Edit `config/initializers/rails_error_dashboard.rb`:

```ruby
RailsErrorDashboard.configure do |config|
  # ============================================================================
  # AUTHENTICATION (Always Required)
  # ============================================================================
  config.dashboard_username = ENV.fetch('ERROR_DASHBOARD_USER', 'gandalf')
  config.dashboard_password = ENV.fetch('ERROR_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD', 'youshallnotpass')

  # ============================================================================
  # OPTIONAL FEATURES (Enable as needed)
  # ============================================================================

  # Slack notifications (if enabled during install)
  config.enable_slack_notifications = true
  config.slack_webhook_url = ENV['SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL']

  # Email notifications (if enabled during install)
  config.enable_email_notifications = true
  config.notification_email_recipients = ["dev@yourapp.com"]
  config.notification_email_from = "errors@yourapp.com"

  # Async logging for better performance (if enabled during install)

## 🚀 Usage

### Automatic Error Tracking

Rails Error Dashboard automatically tracks errors from:
- **Controllers** (via Rails error reporting)
- **Background jobs** (ActiveJob, Sidekiq)
- **Rack middleware** (catches everything else)

No additional code needed! Just install and it works.

### Manual Error Logging

For frontend/mobile apps or custom error logging:

```ruby
# From your Rails API
RailsErrorDashboard::Commands::LogError.call(
  error_type: "TypeError",
  message: "Cannot read property 'name' of null",
  backtrace: ["App.js:42", "index.js:12"],
  platform: "iOS",
  app_version: "2.1.0",
  user_id: current_user.id,
  context: {
    component: "ProfileScreen",
    device_model: "iPhone 14 Pro"
  }
)
```

### Frontend Integration

```javascript
// React Native example
try {
  // Your code
} catch (error) {
  fetch('https://yourapp.com/api/errors', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      error_type: error.name,
      message: error.message,
      backtrace: error.stack.split('\n'),
      platform: Platform.OS, // 'ios' or 'android'
      app_version: VERSION
    })
  });
}
```
