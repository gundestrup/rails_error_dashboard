# An ErrorLog row is a GROUP, not an event. Its occurrence_count says how many
# times that error actually happened, so counting rows reported five users
# hitting one exception as "1 error today, 1 affected user".
#
# Two counting units, kept distinct on purpose:
#
#   events          sum(occurrence_count) -- exact, and includes storm
#                   count-only events, which never create occurrence rows
#   affected users  distinct user_id on OCCURRENCE rows -- the group's own
#                   user_id is overwritten by each new occurrence, so counting
#                   it distinct across groups yields at most one per group.
#                   Storm shedding makes this a floor, which the page says.
