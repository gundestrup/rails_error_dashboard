# P7-T2 — visual and layout QA, measured rather than eyeballed.
#
# Screenshots prove nothing on their own: someone has to look at 200 of them
# and notice a two-pixel clip. The browser already knows whether an element
# overflows — scrollWidth > clientWidth is the same fact a reviewer would be
# squinting for — so these specs assert on geometry and keep screenshots as
# the archive (REQ: "screenshots archived for regression comparison").
#
# Locales are chosen by MEASURED expansion, not by guess (P7-T2 REQ-2 names
# German, but German is not the worst case):
#   fr +27.1%  the widest overall
#   ru +14.5%  the widest SIDEBAR NAV label of any locale —
#              "Влияние на пользователей", 24 chars against English's 11
#   de +20.0%  the requirement's named risk
#   zh-CN -52.8% the opposite failure mode: truncation, not overflow

  # REQ-5, scoped to what this sprint can actually be responsible for.
  #
  # The question P7-T2 exists to answer is whether TRANSLATION breaks the
  # layout — not whether the layout is perfect. Those are different questions,
  # and at 375px the dashboard already answers the second one badly: the navbar
  # is a fixed flex row holding a 240px search input, a theme toggle and an
  # environment badge, and it measures 474px wide in ENGLISH. Verified equal at
  # 474px in en, fr and zh-CN, and unchanged when the language picker is
  # removed from the DOM entirely — so it is neither caused by translation nor
  # by the P5-T1 picker, and it reproduces on main.
  #
  # Asserting an absolute width here would therefore fail for a reason this
  # branch did not cause and cannot fix without a navbar redesign. What IS this
  # sprint's business is that a translated page is no wider than the English
  # one: any excess over the English baseline is expansion, which is exactly
  # what REQ-2 and REQ-5 are about.
  #
  # A 4px tolerance absorbs sub-pixel font metrics; real expansion overflow runs
  # to tens or hundreds of pixels (ru's nav label alone is +13 chars).
  #
  # This briefly went to 20px while the navbar still overflowed: with webfonts
  # blocked (#183) the wider fallback face pushed fr/overview@375 to 448px
  # against a 434px English baseline. Widening the tolerance was the wrong call
  # — the page was genuinely scrolling sideways at 375px in EVERY locale,
  # English included, and loosening a spec to accept that ships the defect to
  # users. The navbar is fixed instead (min-width:0 on its flex groups), so both
  # locales now measure exactly the viewport width and 4px is honest again.
