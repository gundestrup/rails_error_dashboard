# The engine now wires two drains, mirroring the Rack::Attack precedent:
#
#   Rails.application.executor.to_complete { Gate.flush_if_due! }
#   at_exit                                { Gate.drain! }

# The wiring itself is guarded on enable_storm_protection at boot, and the
# dummy app disables storm protection, so these examples exercise the two
# entry points the engine calls rather than the registration.
