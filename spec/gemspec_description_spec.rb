# Guards how rubygems.org renders this gem's description.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the gem page showed one cramped wall of text with an
# unclickable demo link for months, and more than one attempt to fix it failed
# silently — the gemspec looked formatted in the editor while the published page
# was unchanged, because nothing here could tell the difference.
#
# rubygems.org's RubygemsHelper#simple_markup does exactly this:
#
#     if /^==+ [A-Z]/.match?(text)
#       sanitize RDoc::Markup.new.convert(text, RDoc::Markup::ToHtml.new(pipe: true))
#     else
#       tag.p(escape_once(sanitize(text.strip)))
#     end
#
# So the whole outcome hinges on one anchored regexp. These examples reproduce
# that gate and the RDoc conversion rather than asserting on the source text,
# because "the gemspec contains == headings" was true of the broken version too.

  # RDoc's ToHtml constructor changed shape across the versions this gem supports.
  # Modern RDoc (8.x) takes keywords (pipe:, output_decoration:) — the form
  # rubygems.org itself calls. RDoc 6.x, which resolves alongside Rails 7.0, takes
  # a positional RDoc::Options.
  #
  # The trap: on RDoc 6.x the keyword call does NOT raise. `pipe: true` is
  # accepted as a positional Hash and stored as @options, and the failure only
  # surfaces later, mid-conversion, as
  #   NoMethodError: undefined method 'output_decoration' for an instance of Hash
  # So rescuing around the constructor alone is useless — the rescue has to wrap
  # the CONVERSION. That is what broke this spec on all three Rails 7.0 jobs.
