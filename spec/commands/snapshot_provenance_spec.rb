# alone by one that does not (storm :lite, or a feature switched off) -- keeping
# a useful snapshot rather than blanking it.

# What was missing is provenance: the page labelled that collection as the
# error's context without saying which event supplied it, so a row could show a
# new request URL beside a previous occurrence's user id and locals.
