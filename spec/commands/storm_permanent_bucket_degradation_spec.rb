# EventCountWriteFailed, which aborted the surrounding transaction and rolled
# back the lifetime occurrence_count too -- so a host that never migrated the
# rollup table lost its counts entirely. The authoritative total is
# occurrence_count on the group, and it is written independently of the bucket.
