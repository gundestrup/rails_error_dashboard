# occurred_at and the release (app_version / git_sha) used to be resolved when
# the WORKER ran, not when the event was captured. A queue that is backed up
# across a deploy therefore stamped the event with the drain time and with
# whatever version the worker happened to be running -- so an error captured
# at 12:00 under v1 and drained at 14:00 under v2 was stored as 14:00/v2, and
# a release comparison blamed the wrong build.
