# unavailable: it keeps the authoritative lifetime count and skips the bucket.
# But buckets_incomplete was returned in the result hash and then dropped --
# no caller persisted it, no query read it, nothing on the dashboard said so,
# and a replay lost it entirely. A figure of unknown completeness was presented
# as fact.
#
# This is the same contract affected_users_incomplete already honours for
# storm-shed occurrence rows: say the dimension is incomplete rather than
# quietly under-reporting it.

  # made the volume invariants fail only near midnight (expected 15, got 3).
  # Midday leaves a twelve-hour margin either side.

  # below travel again themselves, and Rails rejects a nested travel_to.
