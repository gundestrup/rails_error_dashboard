# The realistic replay is the job's own retry. StormFlushJob raises when a
# batch reconciles nothing, and ApplicationJob retries three times with the
# identical payload; a queue that redelivers does the same. A digest of the
# batch is therefore inserted in the SAME transaction as the increments, so
# either both land or neither does, and a replay hits the unique index.
