# Regression coverage for issue #170 (third report) — "no event gets recorded in
# rails_error_dashboard_rack_attack_events".
#
# WHY THIS FILE USES THE REAL GEM AND NOT DOUBLES:
#
# Two Rack::Attack bugs have now shipped green. Both were invisible to the suite
# for the same reason: every existing spec drove the subscriber with an
# instance_double and drove the tracker by calling flush! directly. A double
# answers whatever the fixture author believed Rack::Attack does, and calling
# flush! by hand skips the question of whether anything ever CALLS it.
#
#   - #170 round 1: fixtures injected "rack.attack.match_discriminator" for a
#     plain `track` rule. Real Rack::Attack never sets that key for a Check, so
#     the blank-discriminator bug could not be reproduced by the suite.
#   - #170 round 3 (this file): the buffer was only ever drained by a LATER event
#     on the SAME thread, so one request persisted nothing. Every spec called
#     flush! explicitly, so the missing drain was invisible.
#
# These specs therefore run requests through a real Rack::Attack middleware with
# a real rule, and assert on the DATABASE without ever calling flush! by hand.
