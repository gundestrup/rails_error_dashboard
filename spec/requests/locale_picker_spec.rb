  # file watcher, and the reload that follows swaps every model's class object
  # mid-example: records created before it compare unequal to the identical
  # rows a scope returns afterwards (same id, same attributes, `==` false).
  # That surfaces as unrelated model specs failing later in the run — the
  # symptom that cost this task most of its debugging time.
  #
  # I18nStore reads its directory through .locales_path, so redirecting that
  # gives RED a second locale with nothing on a watched path.
