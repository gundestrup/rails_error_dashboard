# declared on ErrorsController rather than on ApplicationController, so a
# controller added later inherited no protection and nothing failed to say so.
#
# The generic example below walks the engine's real route set, so a controller
# added tomorrow is covered without anyone remembering to add it here.

  # set for whatever ran next, and spec/requests/authentication_spec.rb logs in
  # as the default gandalf — it got a 401 and failed, but only on the seeds that
  # happened to order it after this file.
