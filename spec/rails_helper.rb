# Build the test schema. Two sources, chosen with RED_TEST_SCHEMA:
#
#   schema      (default on SQLite) load spec/dummy/db/schema.rb — fast, and
#               the file is written for SQLite
#   migrations  (default on every other adapter) run the gem's OWN migrations
#               from db/migrate, which is what a host installs; the CI
#               PostgreSQL/MySQL rows use this so adapter-specific DDL (key
#               limits, FK types, partial and GIN indexes) is exercised
#
# bin/check-schema-parity keeps the two in step.

    # symptom that looks like broken capture rather than config pollution.
    #
    # Many specs set it via `RailsErrorDashboard.configure` and rely on an
    # `after` hook to clean up; an example that errors before its hook runs
    # (or a hook-ordering quirk) leaks it to every later example in the
    # process. The dummy initializer sets it false, but
    # `reset_configuration!` restores GEM defaults, not dummy values — so
    # this hook is the only thing that guarantees a clean slate.
    # Specs that need async opt back in via their own (later-running) hooks.
