    # Command: Find an existing error by hash or create a new one
    # Uses pessimistic locking to prevent race conditions in multi-app scenarios.
    # The whole find-and-write runs inside ONE transaction: a row lock taken
    # by SELECT ... FOR UPDATE lives only as long as the transaction that took
    # it, so a lock on a standalone SELECT was released before the UPDATE ran
    # and two concurrent captures could both read count N and both write N+1.
    #
    # Search order:
    # 0. wont_fix errors with same hash (any age) → increment, status untouched
    # 1. Unresolved errors with same hash within 24 hours → increment occurrence count
    # 2. Resolved errors with same hash (any age) → reopen and increment
    # 3. No match → create new error record
    #
    # Environment is a MATCH dimension, not part of the hash: the same error in
    # staging and production is two rows with independent status. A row with a
    # NULL environment predates the column; it matches as a wildcard and is
    # stamped by the first occurrence that claims it, so history migrates
    # itself without a backfill. An exact match always wins over a NULL one.
