      # serialize the value. Stamping the envelope by calling .iso8601 on the
      # raw input therefore raised NoMethodError for a String (a documented
      # ManualErrorReporter input form), the outer rescue in .call swallowed
      # it, and the capture vanished: nothing enqueued, no row, nothing logged
      # at error level. The sync path accepted the identical input.
