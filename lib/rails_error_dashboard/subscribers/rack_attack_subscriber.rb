    # Rack Attack (v5.0+) emits:
    # - throttle.rack_attack   — rate-limited requests
    # - blocklist.rack_attack  — blocked requests
    # - track.rack_attack      — tracked (observed) requests
    #
    # Each event is captured as a breadcrumb with category "rack_attack",
    # allowing correlation between rate-limit events and error spikes.
    #
    # SAFETY RULES (HOST_APP_SAFETY.md):
    # - Every subscriber wrapped in rescue => e; nil
    # - Never raise from subscriber callbacks
    # - Skip if buffer is nil (not in a request context)

        # WHY (issue #170): a `track` rule declared without :limit/:period is a
        # Rack::Attack::Check, and Check#matched_by? sets only "rack.attack.matched"
        # and "rack.attack.match_type" — never "rack.attack.match_discriminator".
        # Only Throttle#annotate_request_with_matched_data sets that key. The value
        # the rule's block returns (typically `req.ip`) is used purely as a truthy
        # match test and then discarded upstream.
        #
        # Without this fallback every track row stores a blank discriminator, so
        # RackAttackSummary reports "Unique IPs: 0" for a rule that plainly matched
        # real clients. We use request.ip rather than re-invoking the rule's block:
        # the block is arbitrary host code that may have side effects or return a
        # non-IP value, and re-running it from a notification subscriber would
        # execute it a second time per request.
