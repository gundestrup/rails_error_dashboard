      # Layer 1: per-fingerprint rate limiting with graceful degradation.
      #
      # Each fingerprint gets a 60-second window. Within the window:
      #   - first N events            → :full  (everything captured)
      #   - past N, every Mth event   → :lite  (row captured, context shed)
      #   - everything else           → :count_only (in-memory count, flushed later)
      #
      # The first event of every window is ALWAYS at least :lite, so a
      # melting-down fingerprint still has a fresh exemplar each minute —
      # deterministic, unlike rand-based sampling.
      #
      # Calm-mode adaptive context sampling rides the same entries: after K
      # full-context captures per fingerprint per day, context is captured
      # only every Mth time (an error firing 1000×/day doesn't need 1000
      # breadcrumb trails). Occurrence rows are unaffected in calm mode.
      #
      # Concurrency: entries are mutable structs in a Concurrent::Map with
      # plain (unlocked) field increments — races can miscount by a handful
      # of events, which is acceptable for rate limiting. No mutex anywhere.
      #
      # Memory: the map is bounded. Once full, unseen fingerprints are NOT
      # tracked and decide as :full — in calm weather that's harmless; in a
      # storm of unique fingerprints the global breaker (Layer 2) takes over.
