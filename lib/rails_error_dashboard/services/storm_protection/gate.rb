      #                 (breadcrumbs / system health / locals / ivars)

      # Safety contract (mirrors SwallowedExceptionTracker):
      # - FAILS OPEN: any internal error → :full. Protection must never be
      #   the thing that loses an error.
      # - Zero I/O on the hot path. The only DB-adjacent work is enqueueing
      #   the flush job at most once per flush interval.
      # - Budget: digest + atomic increment + comparisons (~µs). Benchmarked.
      # - Per-process state; Puma workers each run their own breaker. No
      #   thread-locals — shared atomics, so no Thread.current cleanup needed.
      #
      # IMPORTANT ordering: callers must run ExceptionFilter (ignore list +
      # static sampling) BEFORE this gate — ignored exceptions must never
      # count toward storm state or be reconciled into ErrorLogs.
