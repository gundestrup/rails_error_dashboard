    # Classifies a User-Agent string into a coarse traffic kind, and names the
    # agent when it is a recognised one.
    #
    # WHY THIS EXISTS (issue #170): tracking which AI agents read an app is the
    # reason people reach for Rack::Attack's `track` rules now. Counting IPs
    # cannot answer it — one agent is a rotating fleet of hundreds of addresses,
    # so unique-IP totals overstate the population badly. The user agent is the
    # signal that actually identifies the reader.
    #
    # Deliberately plain string matching, NOT the `browser` gem: `browser` is an
    # optional dependency that degrades gracefully everywhere else in this gem,
    # and it does not know these agents anyway. This runs on the flush path, not
    # the request path, but it stays allocation-cheap regardless.
    #
    # The bot lists are necessarily a snapshot. An unrecognised agent falls back
    # to :other rather than being guessed at — a wrong attribution is worse than
    # an honest "unknown" when the whole point is measurement.
    class AiAgentClassifier
      # Order matters: the first match wins, so more specific patterns lead.
      #
      # AI agents split into two behaviours worth telling apart, because they
      # answer different questions:
      # - :ai_assistant — fetches on demand, because a human asked something now
      # - :ai_crawler   — bulk-fetches to build a training corpus or index

        # developer's Copilot session asked for, one page at a time — not a bulk
        # corpus crawl.
        #
        # The pattern is deliberately anchored on "GitHubCopilot" rather than a
        # bare /Copilot/i. Microsoft applies the Copilot brand very broadly, and
        # its Copilot features are documented as riding Bingbot infrastructure or
        # sending ordinary Edge/Chromium user agents with no bot signal — so a
        # loose pattern would mislabel plain browser traffic as an AI agent,
        # which is exactly the wrong-attribution failure this class avoids.
        #
        # No authoritative UA documentation exists for this agent: it is absent
        # from GitHub's own docs, from ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt, and from the
        # Dark Visitors catalogue as of 2026-08-29. The pattern therefore matches
        # only what has actually been observed, plus the "-WebFetch" sibling
        # suffix, instead of guessing at variants.
