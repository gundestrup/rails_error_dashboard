    # Buffers Rack::Attack events in a thread-local hash and flushes them to the
    # database asynchronously.
    #
    # WHY THIS EXISTS (issue #143): Rack::Attack events were previously only
    # recorded as breadcrumbs. Breadcrumbs are harvested exclusively by LogError,
    # so an event was only ever persisted if an unrelated exception happened to be
    # raised later in the same request. A throttled request returns HTTP 429 and
    # raises nothing, so the event was always discarded when ErrorCatcher cleared
    # the buffer. This tracker persists events independently of error capture.
    #
    # Events are aggregated by (rule, match_type, discriminator, path, method) and
    # counted, rather than stored one row per event — a rate-limit flood is exactly
    # when we must not do one INSERT per request.
    #
    # SAFETY RULES (HOST_APP_SAFETY.md):
    # - Zero I/O in the record path (hash lookup + integer increment)
    # - Never raises — every public method wrapped in rescue
    # - Thread-local state, no mutex needed
    # - LRU eviction bounds memory (rotating-IP attacks cannot grow it unbounded)
    # - Async flush via background job

      # WHY THE DISTINCTION MATTERS: this used to hold the last flush time and be
      # seeded lazily inside maybe_flush! with `||= now`, which meant the very
      # first event of a buffer set the clock to now and then compared `now - now
      # >= interval` — false, always. A rule that matched once and never again
      # therefore never flushed at all, and a manual `curl` test showed an empty
      # table indefinitely (issue #170, third report). Seeding when the buffer
      # STARTS filling makes the guarantee "buffered data is never older than

        #   1. A rule that matched once showed nothing until the process exited.
        #      `curl` once, look at the dashboard, see an empty table — forever.
        #   2. Worse, Puma reuses and retires threads. Counts buffered on a thread
        #      that dies are unreachable to flush_all_threads! (it walks
        #      Thread.list), so they were lost outright, not merely delayed.
        #      Measured: 5 of 5 events lost when the serving threads exited.
        #
        # ActiveSupport::Executor#to_complete is the right boundary because Rails
        # already guarantees it runs once per request and once per job. Crucially,
