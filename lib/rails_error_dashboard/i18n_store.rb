module RailsErrorDashboard
  # RED's own translation store, deliberately isolated from the host app's I18n.
  #
  # WHY A PRIVATE BACKEND INSTEAD OF THE USUAL ENGINE LOAD PATH
  #
  # The conventional way to translate a Rails engine is to append
  # config/locales to I18n.load_path and namespace the keys. That shares the
  # host's backend, and sharing it hands the host three ways to break the
  # dashboard:
  #
  #   1. config.i18n.raise_on_missing_translations = true turns any key we
  #      forgot into a 500 — on the error dashboard, the one page that has to
  #      work when everything else is broken.
  #   2. enforce_available_locales with a short available_locales list raises
  #      I18n::InvalidLocale as soon as RED asks for its own locale.
  #   3. A custom exception_handler can raise on anything it likes.
  #
  # RED's locale is also deliberately independent of the host's — that is the
  # whole point of issue #148. Sharing a backend would re-create the coupling
  # that bug was about.
  #
  # The trade-off: hosts cannot override RED's strings with their own locale
  # files. That is the right default for a self-hosted ops tool, and it can be
  # relaxed later without breaking anything.
  #
  # NOTHING IN HERE MAY RAISE. Every public method is total: it returns a
  # String for any input, including garbage. See #translate.
